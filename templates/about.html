			<h4><strong> What is The NELA Toolkit? </strong></h4>
			<p style="margin-left:5px; font-size:15px"> 
				The News Landscape (NELA) Toolkit is an open source toolkit for the systematic exploration of the news landscape. The goal of NELA is to both speed up human fact-checking efforts and increase the understanding of online news as a whole.  NELA is made up of multiple indepedent modules, that work at article level granularity: reliability prediction, political impartiality prediction, text objectivity prediction, and reddit community interest prediction. As well as, modules that work at source level granularity: reliability prediction, political impartiality prediction, content-based feature visualization.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h4><strong> How does it work? </strong></h4>
			<p style="margin-left:5px; font-size:15px"> 
				NELA is built using a mix of machine learning techniques on well-studied natural language features. Details can be found in our <a href="">WWW 2018 paper</a>!
			</p>
			<br>
			<h4><strong> Can I use the NELA data set for research? </strong></h4>
			<p style="margin-left:5px; font-size:15px"> 
				Yes! You can request any of our data sets <a href="">here</a>.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h4><strong> Does the NELA Toolkit have an API? </strong></h4>
			<p style="margin-left:5px; font-size:15px"> 
				The NELA Toolkit currently does not have an API, but it is in the works. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<h4><strong> Who made The NELA Toolkit? </strong></h4>
			<p style="margin-left:5px; font-size:15px"> 
			The NELA Toolkit is based on information credibility research by Benjamin Horne and Sibel Adalı, and is built with the help of William Dron and Sara Khedr.

				<b>Benjamin Horne</b> is a PhD student in Computer
				Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. His
				research focuses on online information quality
				and credibility, along with the human decisions
				in assessing online information. This work utilizes
				techniques in machine learning, natural language
				processing, and social network analysis
				to both characterize and detect the veracity information, in hopes
				of not only building better tools for decision making, but in understanding
				how the human impacts those decisions. To learn more about his work, <a href="http://homepages.rpi.edu/~horneb/">check out his website</a>.
				<br></br>
				<b>William Dron</b> is a Senior Scientist at
				Raytheon BBN Technologies, where he has
				worked since 2004. William has a background
				in communications networks and computer science,
				particularly for military use. Over the past
				8 years, he has focused on cross network genre
				experimentation and has incorporated social and
				information sciences in his work. He is particularly interested in
				utilizing software engineering principles and visualizations to create
				cohesive and scalable software solutions.
				<br></br>
				<b>Sara Khedr</b> is a Master’s student in the Computer
				Science department at Rensselaer Polytechnic
				Institute (RPI). She received her Bachelor’s
				degree in Computer and System Engineering
				from RPI. During her education, Sara has focused
				on attaining general software development experience
				and has previously interned for Workday
				and Salesforce, two SaaS companies.
				<br></br>
				<b>Dr. Sibel Adalı</b> is a Professor and Associate
				Head of Computer Science at Renssealer Polytechnic
				Institute. Her research concentrates on
				cross-cutting problems related to trust, information
				processing, and social networks. As part
				of her work, she has worked as the ARL-lead
				Network Science Collaborative Technology Alliance
				(NS-CTA) wide Trust Coordinator, Social and Cognitive Networks
				Academic Research Center (SCNARC) Associate Director.
				She serves as associate editor for ACM Transactions on Internet
				Technology. She is the author of a book on Modeling Trust Context
				in Networks, released in 2013 by Springer. For more on her work, <a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~sibel/SibelAdali/Sibel_Adali.html">check out her website</a>.
				<br></br>
				Research was sponsored by the Army Research Laboratory and was
				accomplished under Cooperative Agreement Number W911NF-09-2-0053 (the
				ARL Network Science CTA). The views and conclusions contained in this
