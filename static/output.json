      "title": "Betsy DeVos Says Media Shouldnt Emphasize First Hundred Days Because Its So Hard to Count to a Hundred", 
      "text": "WASHINGTON ( The Borowitz Report )Education Secretary Betsy DeVos criticized the media on Friday for placing so much emphasis on Donald Trumps first hundred days, because its so darn hard to count to a hundred.\n\nIm watching the news and theyre going on about a hundred days this and a hundred days that, and all I want to say is, Who the heck can count all the way to a hundred?  she said. Theyre acting like were a bunch of math geniuses.\n\nDeVos added that, if the media wanted to establish a benchmark for Trumps achievement, they should have picked a number of days that people can actually count to, like five or ten.\n\nThe Education Secretary then demonstrated how it was possible to count to ten using ones hands.\n\nDespite the medias obsession with ridiculously big numbers, DeVos said she has no intention of trying to count to a hundred.\n\nI have an important job and the last thing I need is to do something that makes my head hurt, she said.",

      "text": "French President Francois Hollande has used a ceremony to honour a police officer slain in Paris last week to call for unity in the \"long and difficult fight against terrorism\".\n\nHe awarded Xavier Jugele, 37, the Legion of Honour, one of France's highest honours.\n\nThe two candidates to succeed Mr Hollande, Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen, both attended.\n\nThey will face off at a second round of voting on 7 May.\n\nMr Jugele, 37, was killed with a Kalashnikov rifle while on duty on the Champs Elysees avenue last Thursday, The main suspect is convicted criminal Karim Cheurfi.\n\n\"Once again France has lost one of its bravest sons,\" Mr Hollande said. \"Once again the Republic has lost one of its most valuable guardians.\"\n\nHe said France's struggle against Islamist terrorism was \"a fight that is going to last, a fight that will be waged until the threat is completely neutralised\".\n\nMr Jugele's partner, Etienne Cardiles, gave a moving tribute to his loved one, who had campaigned for gay rights and volunteered in Greece to help with the migrant crisis.\n\n\"I suffer without hatred,\" he said.\n\nThe issue of security sharply divides the presidential candidates, who were appearing together in public for the first time, though discreetly.\n\nThey were among a large group of politicians and public figures who watched as the flag-draped coffin was brought into the courtyard of police headquarters.\n\nMs Le Pen wants France to reintroduce border controls and deport all foreigners on a terror watchlist.\n\nMr Macron, an advocate of open borders, has urged French citizens not to give in to fear.\n\nOriginally from the Loire Valley region in central France, he had reportedly been serving in the capital since 2014.\n\nOn 13 November 2015, he was deployed to secure the area around the Bataclan concert hall after the attack by the so-called Islamic State group.\n\nWhen the venue reopened last November with a concert by Sting, Mr Jugele was there again, telling the US magazine People: \"I'm happy to be here... We're here tonight as witnesses. Here to defend our civic values. This concert's to celebrate life. To say no to terrorists.\"",

      "text": "Trumps loyal supporters either dont know about the constant stream of attacks the president has suffered since his January 20 inauguration, or they dont believe the claims that have caused the Department of Justice to appoint a special prosecutor to look into ties between the president and Russia. Others say they dont even care about any of it, according to the Associated Press.\n\nFrom the quiet streets of New Yorks working-class Staten Island to small-town Denison, Iowa, and even smaller Rutledge, Georgia, The AP reported, Trump may be as popular today as when he was elected. Voters are standing with a president who tweeted on Thursday that he is the target of the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!'\n\nThus far, accusations that Donald Trump coordinated with Russian officials during his recent campaign for president have little basis in fact. There is little if any evidence of any such collusion. But the accusations again kicked into high gear after a story by The New York Times claimed the president urged then FBI Director James Comey to stop investigating former national security adviser Mike Flynn.\n\nBut despite the fact that Washington and the left-wing media are consumed by the story, the AP notes that Trumps supporters dont seem interested in the accusations.\n\nI tuned it out, mother and Trump supporter Michele Velardi told the AP. I didnt want to be depressed. I dont want to feel that hes not doing what he said, so I just choose to not listen.\n\nAnother Trump supporter, 19-year-old Joseph Amodeo, attacked Trumps critics saying, If youre wishing for him to fail, youre basically wishing for the pilot of the plane to crash. You just gotta stick by him and hopefully, he does things that benefit everyone.\n\n27-year-old Robbie Foy of Rutledge, Georgia, said that he is sticking with Trump and has not changed his mind over why he voted to Make America Great Again.\n\nTrumps not in it for the money. Hes got plenty of money, Foy said. On the other hand, Foy insisted that Clinton was in it for herself.\n\nState Assemblyman Ron Castorina, who represents Staten Island, told the AP that he thinks people are getting even stronger in their support.\n\nNot only have I not heard of anyone turning their backs, Ive seen people become more in solidarity with the president because they feel hes getting a raw deal, Castorina told the wire service.\n\nSo, if the APs reporting is any indication, Trumps supporters are still sticking with him.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston, or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.",

      "title": "United Messes Up Again: Flies Customer to San Francisco Instead of France", 
      "text": "United customer Lucie Bahetoukilae had purchased a ticket to fly from Newark, New Jersey, to Paris, France, but instead, found herself landing in San Francisco, California, after she was allowed to board the wrong plane, according to Fox News.\n\nThe woman, who only speaks French, told the media through a relative that the airline changed her flights gate at the last minute but did not inform customers via email or text, so she did not understand the announcement made over the loudspeaker system. She also said the gate change was announced only in English and not French, so she stayed at her original gate and boarded the plane that eventually arrived in California.\n\nThough her ticket said her final destination was Paris, attendants allowed her to board the plane for San Francisco, Bahetoukilae said.\n\nIf they would have made the announcement in French, she would have moved gates, Bahetoukilaes niece, Diane Miantsoko, told New Yorks ABC 7.\n\nEven more vexing for the French-speaking woman, when she boarded the California-bound plane, she found someone already sitting in the seat marked on her ticket. And when she showed her boarding pass to a flight attendant, she was simply put in an open seat, instead of being told she boarded the wrong plane.\n\nThe mixup angered Bahetoukilaes niece. With everything going on this country people have to be more careful. They didnt pay attention. My aunt could have been anyone. She could have been a terrorist and killed people on that flight, she said.\n\nFor its part, United issued an apology to the customer:\n\nWe deeply apologize to Ms. Bahetoukilae for this unacceptable experience, United said in an emailed statement to Fox News. When she arrived in San Francisco, we ensured she got on the next flight to Paris and refunded her ticket. Our customer care team has reached out to her directly to ensure we make this right. We are also working with our team in Newark to prevent this from happening again.\n\nThe airlines practices exploded in controversy in April after its treatment of passenger Dr. David Dao when police bodily dragged the man off a flight when he refused to give up his seat in an overbooking incident. The airline later settled with the passenger and made changes to its overbooking practices.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.",

No charges were filed.\n\nThe NRA has long touted itself as a champion of gun safety, but the incident highlights the dangers posed by firearms, even when stored or holstered. According to the Gun Violence Archive, there were 2,200 unintentional shootings in 2016, and 549 incidents have already occurred so far in 2017.\n\nMeanwhile, the NRA has hosted seminars in which speakers encourage gun owners to store firearms in childrens bedrooms  despite that fact that children are often involved in unintentional shootings. According to data collected by gun safety group Everytown, at least 247 people were accidentally shot by children in 2016, and at least 58 have occurred so far this year.\n\nOverall, the Gun Violence Archive has tracked 15,704 incidents of gun violence in 2017.\n\nThis post was updated to clarify that the victims gun went off as he was holstering it.",

We block the funding. No more funding,\" Mr. Trump said on the campaign trail.\n\n\"The court ruled, those words have unconstitutional consequences,\" said attorney Louise Renne, who filed the brief supporting San Francisco's lawsuit.\n\nThe administration can't simply stop giving federal money to these cities, Renne explained, because it is Congress that provides the funds, not the president.\n\n\"The president doesn't have the power to take away those federal funds,\" Renne said.\n\nPotentially, hundreds of billions of dollars were at stake for more than 118 sanctuary cities and regions.\n\nIn Santa Clara county, it would be a budget breaker, with the county estimating it could lose $4-5 million a day on average.\n\nBut in Florida's heavily immigrant Miami-Dade, county commissioners were so worried about losing funds, they voted to fully cooperate with immigration authorities, rather than risk losing the federal money.\n\nOn Twitter, Mr. Trump vowed to fight the judge's order all the way to the Supreme Court. He also threatened to break up the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which has blocked two of his previous immigration orders.",

      "title": "Trump's TV Obsession Is a First", 
      "text": "President Trump loves Fox & Friends. At 6:24 a.m. on Monday, Trump gushed on Twitter about the amazing reporting on the morning talk show. A week earlier he instructed the nation to watch @foxandfriends now for their exemplary Russia coverage. He tweeted about the program, hosted by Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhardt, and Brian Kilmeade, seven times in March alone, and recently brought it up in an interview with Fox News Tucker Carlson, telling him cheerfully, I like that group of three people. Even after becoming president, Trump reportedly manages to fill his days with plenty of television, and from his tweets, its often possible to discern whenand whathes watching. In January, Axios broke down the presidents media diet: Most mornings, Trump flicks on the TV and watches \"Morning Joe,\" often for long periods of time, sometimes interrupted with texts to the hosts or panelists. After the 6 a.m. hour of \"Joe,\" he's often on to \"Fox & Friends\" by 7 a.m., with a little CNN before or after. He also catches the Sunday shows, especially \"Meet the Press.\" \"The shows,\" as he calls them, often provoke his tweets. The day of our interview with him, all of his tweet topics were discussed during the first two hours of \"Morning Joe. The Republican Party Emerges From Decades of Court Supervision Based on their breakdown and this visual guide made by The Washington Post, Trump watches an average of five hours of television every day. Thats almost the same amount the average American aged 50-64 watches daily, according to Nielsen. Trumps habits dont quite match up with those of his cohortAmericans in Trumps age bracket (65+) watch roughly seven hours of TV a day. But many of them are retired, and Trump is the president of the United States. No former president seems to have spent this much time glued to his television set. For most of Americas recent commanders-in-chief, watching a little TV was a brief break from politics and criticism, a welcome respite from the pressures of the job, or a chance to feel normal. But none consumed as much television as Trump, or reacted as quickly or directly to what they were seeing. Things havent gone smoothly for Trump during his first 70 days in office, so perhaps its an escape for him, tooa way for him to return to the role he used to play in American politics: that of watcher and critic.\n\nBut its a real problem to have a president that has that kind of obsession, said Russell Riley, a presidential scholar at University of Virginia Miller Center. The most valuable commodity in Washington is the presidents time, bar nothing. A president who elects to invest a lot of his time in tracking his own media coverage is, to some extent, debasing his own currency. During their presidencies, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama were besieged by media criticism, Riley said. Instead of watching the talking heads, they preferred to use television as an escape. The media tends to be mainly incumbent unfriendly, and thats the role of media in a democratic society, to be oppositionist, Riley said. They understood that part of being presidential was having thick skin and ignoring what was going on. Not so for Trump. The president has brought his campaign-trail feud with the media to the White House, continuing to watch the political pundits on television, responding with praise for some and insults for others. Aides have reportedly attempted to minimize Trumps TV-watching, but, so far, it hasnt worked. He was elected because he was a reality TV star, Riley told me. It is a bit less surprising, then, that he would have a hard time tearing himself away. MSNBC and Fox News are cashing in on Trumps viewing habits, reportedly hiking up ad rates in February as companies and outside groups try to influence Trump and his top lieutenants through ads on his favorite networks.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, multiple stories were published comparing Trump and former President Ronald Reagan: Both worked in the entertainment business, and both were initially seen as political outsiders with a long shot at the presidency. As president, Reagan, too, would show up to work in the Oval Office around 9 a.m., relatively late for White House standards, and on a normal day, hed clock out promptly at 5 p.m. But after returning to the residence, the Gipper filled his free time in very different ways. News was different then: There were only a handful of networks, and news programs only lasted about 30 minutes, but Reagan would fit in about an hour of television on a normal day. Reagan biographer Craig Shirley told me the president would occasionally have guests over for movie-watching parties, too. (Shirley said Reagan once held a small viewing party to watch An Officer and a Gentleman and was traumatized by the amount of gratuitous sex.) Mainly, Reagan was a reader. He literally invented Tom Clancy, Shirley told me, adding that The Hunt for Red October, Clancys breakout novel, became successful really just because Reagan happened to be reading it. The president also kept a daily diary and sent handwritten letters to colleagues and constituents nearly every day. I think Reagan was far more intellectually curious than Trump. He was far more of an intellectual conservative, Shirley said. [He] not only read things, he retained them. He could recite poems from memory.\n\nThe 41st president wasnt a big TV-watcher either. George H. W. Bush would rise at around 6 a.m. and start reading the papers. Unlike Reagan, hed hold his daily meetings pretty early, around 7:30 a.m. He was a diligent worker with no fixed r and r, no fixed exercise schedule, even though he was active, said Ed Rogers, a former deputy assistant to Bush. It was the early days of CNN, and Bush liked the evening broadcast. Americans were transfixed by television coverage of the Gulf War, and it was always on in White House offices. Bush liked to watch, but he didnt have patience to watch for long periods of time. There were very few of those discretionary, sit at home and take your shoes off kind of evenings, Rogers said. Bush was energetic and didnt long for more idle time. Since the development of cable news, the television sets positioned in hallways and offices throughout the White House have all been tuned to a 24-hour news channel, like Fox or CNN. Theres a sort of background hum of television all the time, Riley said. But Americas next three presidents mostly tuned in for one thing: sports. Clintons TV-watching was idiosyncratic and episodic, Riley told me. He loved college basketball and football. In an interview with the Miller Center, Bernard Nussbaum, who served as Clintons White House Counsel, recounted the night the president was supposed to ask D.C. Circuit Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court: He said, Yes, yes, okay, well appoint her. I said Good. Why dont you give her a call? He said, I cant do that. This was in the afternoon, I think, if I have it right. Ive got some friends coming over, Ive got to watch the [basketball] game on television. I said, What time does [it] start?* He said, No, Ive got these friends. Ill do it later. I said, You should really call her up. He said, Ill call her, Ill call her, but I cant do it now. Ill do it later. I say, What time is the game over? Im in my office on a Sunday, hes in the residence with his friends and everything. He said, Were going to have dinner, the game will be over around 11 oclock at night or midnight. I said, Oh God. After the game endedsometime between 11 and midnightClinton appointed Ginsburg, who would later be confirmed as the Supreme Courts second female justice.\n\nFormer presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama also preferred using their free time to watch sports. In January 2002, Bush famously lost consciousness after choking on a pretzel in the White House residence while watching the Baltimore Ravens playing the Miami Dolphins on TV. Obama said he always watched ESPNs SportsCenter while working out, and once told Disney chairman Bob Iger that he hoped to someday host SportsCenters Top 10 List. The president with television-watching habits most similar to Trumps is probably Lyndon B. Johnson, who famously installed three television sets in the Oval Office so he could see what the three major networks were saying about him on the evening news. LBJ had a Texas-sized ego in a way that Trump has a New York-Manhattan-sized ego, Riley said. Theres a certain parallel in their sensing the universe tends to revolve around them. The difference is, Johnson would only need to turn on the television for 15 to 30 minutes every evening to consume the days news and see all the coverage of his administration. The ritual wasnt terribly intrusive, Riley said, and didnt distract from the presidents day-to-day work. Todays 24-hour news cycle, in which the days developments are rehashed on cable shows and Twitter all night long, requires much more time to follow. Americas recent commanders-in-chief didnt attempt to keep up. They knew there were more important things for a president to do than watching television, Riley said. What Im hearing is this is not a lesson that President Trump has yet come by. *This article has been updated to remove specific mention of University of Arkansas's basketball team; after publication, Russell Riley clarified that Bernard Nussbaum misremembered the game in question.",

      "text": "Donald Trump promised from the beginning of his presidential campaign to bring jobs back to the US, and according to him, hes following through.\n\nEconomic confidence is soaring as we unleash the power of private sector job creation and stand up for the American Workers. #AmericaFirst\n\nIn fact, according to Trump, hes created 600,000 jobs since hes been in the White House. Of course, hes either mistaken or just flat out lying.\n\nThe guy who has promised to be the greatest jobs producer that God ever created said:\n\nA closer look at government statistics will tell that its not nearly even close to the number hes quoted as using.\n\nSince January 20, according to preliminary statistics provided by the U.S. Labor Department, 219,000 new jobs were created in February, and in 98,000 in Marsh. That would bring the grand total to nearly half the number of jobs Trump insists hes created at 317,000 new jobs total.\n\nWhile the creation of new jobs is definitely a positive thing, there are other factors to consider, like the environmental regulations he plans to destroy in order to employ American workers.",

      "title": "White House 100 Days webpage plays up 'historic pace' of Trump action", 
      "text": "With no legislative accomplishments of any significance to tout, the White House is hinging it's 100-day success story on the shear volume of executive orders President Trump has signed.\n\nA 100-day webpage on the White House site plays up the 'historic pace' with which Trump has signed directives laying out his priorities and unraveling Barack Obama's.\n\n'The President is keeping his promises to the American people,' it declares, pointing to the rebuilding of the military, the ending of illegal immigration and the restoration of confidence in the economy as examples.\n\nTrump has only accomplished one of those tasks - economic confidence - and many of the pledges he made in a campaign blueprint for his first three months in office have not been met.\n\nHe did not, for instance, put forward a proposal to fully fund his border. His administration has not offered a Constitutional amendment to enact term limits, and it has not demanded a five-year ban on lobbying for congressional officials, in order to 'drain the swamp.'\n\nNot only did Trump fail to name China a currency manipulator, he's reversed course. The president now says Beijing is playing by the rules.\n\nMost notable of Trump's unfulfilled promises from his 'Contract with the American Voter' is Obamacare repeal and replacement. He explicitly promised a full dismantling of 2010 law in his first 100 days, and it still hasn't happened.\n\nThe White House admitted on Monday that Obamacare repeal is the only legislation Trump promised that he's even tried to pass.\n\nNine other laws he said he'd get through haven't been introduced by the Republican-run Congress.\n\n'Right. And I think we're going to continue to work with Congress -- as he says in that document, I will work with Congress to achieve these things; we are going to continue to work with Congress to achieve those,' White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said.\n\nChanging the focus of the argument, Spicer said, 'I think when you look at what he has done in terms of the Supreme Court justice, the executive orders, the number of legislation, there's a lot that has gotten done.\n\n'I remember very clearly the first few weeks and still, to some extent, the comments that got made about the pace that we were keeping and we have kept. The President has been extremely busy,' Spicer said.\n\nThe Trump spokesman said his questioner, ABC's Jon Karl, had zeroed in on a few unkept promises and decided to 'nitpick a couple of them.'\n\n'I dont think there's any question that the President has done a significant amount for the American people on the issues that he has put forward during the campaign,' Spicer said.\n\nTrump's 100-day website lists among his accomplishments his administration's approval of the Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines, his appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, a 17-year drop in illegal border crossings, his 'decisive action' after the chemical attack in Syria and sanctions on Iran.\n\nPresident Trump's negotiations with Lockheed Martin to get the prices of the F-35 fighter jets down is listed, too. So is a five-year lobbying ban on and lifetime foreign lobbying ban for White House officials.\n\nA claim that he's is 'boosting' the military's strength and 'empowering' soldiers to fight links to a speech he delivered in at the USS Gerald Ford as it was about to be commissioned.\n\nIn it Trump said he was calling on Congress to appropriate more money to the military - but that's already listed on the site in a separate section.\n\nThat line says Trump 'advocated increasing the national security budget by $54 billion.' He did ask for the money, but it was in next year's budget. Congress will not debate it until the fall.\n\nTrump has berated the 100th-day mark as arbitrary, but his administration has been taking a victory lap, anyhow.\n\n'When you look at the number of pieces of legislation, the executive orders, business confidence, the place  the U.S.'s role in the world, there's a lot that we feel, accomplishments that have occurred,' Spicer said Monday\n\n'And we feel very good about what we've done as we head up to this first 100 days. But I think you're going to continue to see a lot of action and a lot of results going into the second 100 days, the third 100 days, all the way through.'\n\nA 14-page draft of the actions it intends to highlight titled '100 Days Of Accomplishments' leaked Monday and included items not on the website that observers hit as suspect.\n\nThe document, first published by CNN, reads like the opposition research memos produced by the Republican National Committee's research department, with each item followed by a citation in parentheses  and a link to an online document backing it up.\n\nBut instead of being a hit-piece meant to tear an opponent down, the list is intended to give administration officials a list of talking points to emphasize in Trump's defense.\n\nIt ran the gamut from trade and job creation to immigration and national security, and ended with a reference to the confirmation of Gorsuch.\n\nAlso included was 'Travel Restrictions On Select Countries,' the president's travel-ban order that was quickly put on hold in federal court.\n\nOf the 37 items overall, 23 of them were the result of executive orders or memoranda, directing federal agencies to take the kinds of action that don't require buy-in from Congress.\n\nPresident Trump was openly critical of President Barack Obama during his campaign for relying on unilateral executive orders to accomplish his agenda, instead of going through the legislative process.\n\nAnd yet, another paper statement that came out Tuesday boasted that Trump had signed 30 executive orders to Obama's 19.\n\n'In office, President Trump has accomplished more in his first 100 days than any other President since Franklin Roosevelt,' it said.\n\nIn addition to the orders Trump has also signed 28 laws to Obama's 11, it declared.",

      "title": "Trump to order increased scrutiny of H-1B visa program", 
      "text": "President Trump will travel to Wisconsin Tuesday, where he will sign an order aimed at changing a visa program that brings in highly skilled workers from overseas.\n\nThe order, dubbed \"Buy American, Hire American,\" would direct the departments of Homeland Security, Justice, Labor and State to propose new rules to prevent immigration fraud and abuse. Those departments would also be asked to offer changes so that H-1B visas are awarded to the \"most-skilled or highest-paid applicants.\"\n\nThe White House said the H-1B program is currently undercutting American workers by bringing in cheaper labor and said some tech companies are using it to hire large numbers of workers and drive down wages.\n\n\n\nAdministration officials said the order also seeks to strengthen requirements that American-made products be used in certain federal construction projects, as well as in various federal transportation grant-funded projects. The officials said the commerce secretary will review how to close loopholes in enforcing the existing rules and provide recommendations to the president.\n\n\n\nThe order specifically asks the secretary to review waivers of these rules that exist in free-trade agreements. The administration said that if the waivers are not benefiting the United States they will be \"renegotiated or revoked.\"\n\n\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump said at some points he supported high-skilled visas, then came out against them. At one debate, he called for fully ending the program, saying: \"It's very bad for our workers and it's unfair for our workers. And we should end it.\"\n\n\n\nThe officials said the changes could be administrative or legislative and could include higher fees for the visas, changing the wage scale for the program or other initiatives.\n\n\n\nAbout 85,000 H-1B visas are distributed annually by lottery. Many go to technology companies, which argue that the United States has a shortage of skilled technology workers.\n\n\n\nBut critics say the program has been hijacked by staffing companies that use the visas to import foreigners -- often from India -- who will work for less than Americans. The staffing companies then sell their services to corporate clients who use them to outsource tech work.\n\n\n\nEmployers from Walt Disney World to the University of California in San Francisco have laid off their tech employees and replaced them with H-1B visa holders. Adding to the indignity: The U.S. workers are sometimes asked to train their replacements to qualify for severance packages.\n\n\n\nOn the planned order by Trump, Ronil Hira, a professor in public policy at Howard University and a critic of the H-1B program, told the Associated Press, \"It's better than nothing.\" But he added, \"It's not as aggressive as it needs to be.\"\n\n\n\nThe tech industry has argued that the H-1B program is needed because it encourages students to stay in the U.S. after getting degrees in high-tech specialties -- and they can't always find enough American workers with the skills they need.\n\n\n\nCongress is considering several bills to overhaul the visa program. One, introduced by Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, would require companies seeking H-1B visas to first make a good-faith effort to hire Americans, a requirement many companies can dodge under the current system; give the Labor Department more power to investigate and sanction H-1B abuses; and give \"the best and brightest\" foreign students studying in the U.S. priority in getting H-1B visas.\n\n\n\nTrump will sign the order at the Kenosha headquarters of tool manufacturer Snap-on Inc. His visit comes as the president faces an approval rating of just 41 percent in Wisconsin, a state he barely won in November. The visit also would take him to the congressional district of House Speaker Paul Ryan, who won't be joining the president because he's on a bipartisan congressional trip visiting NATO countries.\n\n\n\nTrump has traveled to promote his agenda less than his recent predecessors. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump wanted to visit \"a company that builds American-made tools with American workers.\"\n\n\n\nTrump carried Wisconsin in November by nearly 23,000 votes -- less than 1 percentage point -- making him the first Republican to win the state since 1984. He campaigned on the promise of returning manufacturing jobs that have been lost in Upper Midwest states.\n\n\n\nFounded in Wisconsin in 1920, Snap-on makes hand and power tools, diagnostics software, information and management systems, and shop equipment for use in a variety of industries, including agriculture, the military and aviation. It has eight manufacturing sites in North America, including one in Milwaukee. The company employs about 11,000 people worldwide.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Although he uses a wheelchair, he wanted to stand to dance with Downs.\n\nWe had talked about how we would dance, but never really came to any conclusions about it, Downs, 34, told Yahoo Style.

There are lots of ways to dance in a wheelchair or with someone who uses a wheelchair.\n\nBut Martineau, an Air Force veteran, didnt want to dance in his wheelchair. So his friends built a system of wires and pulleys in the barn in Plant City, Florida, where their wedding reception took place in order to allow him to stand upright to dance.\n\nHe is a sneaky guy like that, said Downs, a Ph.D. candidate in applied anthropology at the University of South Florida in Tampa. I stay pretty busy, and I just never forced the issue of inquiring about it. I figured we would just do what we always do ... and that is have fun!\n\nDowns was touched by the surprise, but said, I would dance with my husband regardless of any of this.\n\nI fell in love with this man because he challenges me to be better, and he pushes me to complete my goals, she said. We have built a really beautiful life together. And this is coming from someone who four years ago said she would never get married! Im the lucky one.\n\nHe makes me feel special every day by being such an authentic and caring person, she added. I wouldnt change a thing.",

      "text": "If Mexico doesnt end up paying for that border wall, it may fall on another enabler of illegal immigration: sanctuary cities.\n\nAs many of you are aware, there are hundreds of cities and counties nationwide that offer sanctuary status to illegal immigrants. Most simply dont report illegal immigrants to federal authorities for the crime of being undocumented. However, the crazies in more liberal cities like NYC take it a step further.\n\nNYCs mayor Bill DeBlasio doesnt even report illegals to federal law enforcement if theyre caught drunk driving, so long as they dont harm anyone while drunk driving.\n\nTo little surprise, most illegals choose to reside in sanctuary cities. There are an estimated 10-15 million illegal immigrants in the U.S., and 60 percent live in just 20 sanctuary cities. Ironically, thanks to sanctuary cities, ICE is playing a game of hide and seek rigged in their favor. And also thanks to their refusal to comply with federal immigration law, Trump has signed an executive order allowing the federal government to withhold all federal grants from those cities, unless they are to abandon their sanctuary status.\n\nIf they dont, theres a heck of a lot of money on the line. Heres just how much is at stake for the nations largest sanctuary cities:\n\nLook at all sanctuary cities and the number of federal dollars they receive totals a whopping $27 billion.\n\nGiven that the higher estimates for the cost of Trumps border wall are a hefty $25 billion, its clear what that money could be used for.\n\nLets build a wall  and make the sanctuary cities pay for it.",

      "title": "CBS, NBC Celebrate Obamas First Public Appearance Since Inauguration", 
      "text": "Former President Barack Obama made his first public appearance at the University of Chicago on Monday, where the liberal media championed his return. Meantime tonight, we're hearing from former President Obama speaking out in his first public event since leaving office, jumping back into the spotlight and a lot of attention focused on what he would say about his successor, President Trump, hyped Anchor Lester Holt during NBC Nightly News.\n\nHillary Clinton super-fan, Andrea Mitchell glorified his return but seemed disheartened that Obama had chosen not to attack President Trump. Today former President Obama breaking his public silence for the first time since leaving the White House, he reported. Back in Chicago, signaling he will not lead the resistance against Donald Trump.\n\nAccording to Mitchell, Obamas aides told her that he was deliberately not mentioning Trump. Ignoring the President's explosive Twitter accusation that Obama wiretapped him, and his other slams, she explained. As an example of one of Trumps other slams, Mitchell played a clip of the current President saying I inherited a mess. Thats the same criticism Obama leveled at his predecessor for eight long years and the media didnt have a problem with it then.\n\nMitchell also hyped the A-lister lifestyle the Obamas had been living since January 20. Spending the past months kite surfing with Richard Branson, vacationing on music mogul David Geffens luxurious yacht in Tahiti. Michelle Obamas tweeter feed: pure romance no politics, she touted.\n\nFormer aides say that Mr. Obama wants to avoid criticizing President Trump, the way George W. Bush refused to criticize him, she seemed to whine. Even though that is frustrating some democratic activists.\n\nOn CBS Evening News, Anchor Scott Pelley couldnt be happier to see Obama. Today man who never lost a presidential election made his first major appearance since leaving office, he began the segment by saying.\n\nReporter Dean Reynold was impressed by how Mr. Obama appeared cool and at ease to a degree only a former president can appreciate. He also praised how:\n\nIn closing out his report, Reynolds advertised the former Presidents next public engagement. Mr. Obama's next public appearance, Scott, will be May 7th in Boston where he will accept the Kennedy Library's Profiles in Courage Award, he noted.\n\nLESTER HOLT: Meantime tonight, we're hearing from former President Obama speaking out in his first public event since leaving office, jumping back into the spotlight and a lot of attention focused on what he would say about his successor, President Trump. NBC's Andrea Mitchell has details. ANDREA MITCHELL: Today former President Obama breaking his public silence for the first time since leaving the White House. BARACK OBAMA: What's been going on since I've been gone? MITCHELL: Back in Chicago signaling he will not lead the resistance against Donald Trump. OBAMA: The single most important thing I can do is to help in any way I can prepare the next generation of leadership. MITCHELL: In fact, aides say deliberately not mentioning Trump, ignoring the President's explosive Twitter accusation that Obama wiretapped him, and his other slams. JOSH EARNEST: While he certainly doesn't agree with a large number of the decisions that have been made, this is the outcome of the election. MITCHELL: When they left Washington, the Obamas said they would be dropping out for a while. MICHELLE OBAMA: First, we're going to take a little break. MITCHELL: Spending the past months kite surfing with Richard Branson, vacationing on music mogul David Geffens luxurious yacht in Tahiti. Michelle Obamas tweeter feed: pure romance no politics. But Barack Obama today admitting his youthful idealism-- OBAMA: There is not a liberal America and conservative America. There is the United States of America. OBAMA: There is a lot more that people have in common than divides them but obviously, it's not true when it comes to our politics. MITCHELL: Former aides say that Mr. Obama wants to avoid criticizing President Trump, the way George W. Bush refused to criticize him. Even though that is frustrating some democratic activists, Lester? HOLT: All right Andrea Mitchell, thank you.\n\nSCOTT PELLEY: Today man who never lost a presidential election made his first major appearance since leaving office. Dean Reynolds is in Chicago now with the reemergence of Barack Obama. DEAN REYNOLDS: Mr. Obama appeared cool and at ease to a degree only a former president can appreciate. BARACK OBAMA: What's been going on while I've been gone? [Laughter] REYNOLDS: At the University of Chicago where he once taught constitutional law, the 44th president chartered a post-presidential future. OBAMA: The single most important thing I can do is to help in any way I can prepare the next generation of leadership to take up the baton and to take their own crack at changing the world. REYNOLDS: There was no mention of Donald Trump, no response to the frantic attempts to erase the Obama legacy or the evidence-free charges that he tapped Mr. Trump's phones. Instead, after several months vacationing and decompressing with friends, Mr. Obama chose a forum with budding political activists to recall his days here as a community organizer. OBAMA: There's a reason why I'm always optimistic, even when things look like they're sometimes not going the way I want. And that is because of young people like this. REYNOLDS: Mr. Obama did criticize generally what he sees as a broken system in Washington. OBAMA: Special interests dominate the debates in Washington in ways that don't match up with what the broad majority of Americans feel. REYNOLDS: And he had some advice for those seeking to follow his path into politics. OBAMA: Worry less about what you want to be and worry more about what you want to do. REYNOLDS: Mr. Obama's next public appearance, Scott, will be May 7th in Boston where he will accept the Kennedy Library's Profiles in Courage Award.",

Morans.\n\nEVEN CNNs liberally biased media critic Brian Stelter had to admit it wasnt censorship:\n\nHeres more on what the FCC is doing:\n\nLate night talk show host Stephen Colberts controversial joke about President Trump drew the attention of the Federal Communications Commission. The agency received a number of complaints about Colberts commentary earlier in the week, according to the FCCs chief. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai promised to take the appropriate action following a comprehensive investigation of Colberts remarks. The FCCs response will depend on whether Colberts remarks are considered obscene. We are going to take the facts that we find and we are going to apply the law as its been set out by the Supreme Court and other courts and well take the appropriate action, he told Talk Radio 1210 WPHT Thursday.\n\nThis is their JOB, this is their entire REASON for existing!! LOL dumb liberals!\n\nBroadcast television is governed by different rules depending on the time of day, Pai said Wednesday, prior to viewing Colberts comments. The FCC flags speech it considers indecent before 10 p.m., he told Fox Business Network, and looks for obscene content after that point. Colberts The Late Show airs at 11:35 p.m. ET on CBS. The agencys website states that content must meet a three-tier Supreme Court test to be labeled obscene. It must appeal to an average persons prurient interest; depict or describe sexual conduct in a patently offensive way; and, taken as a whole, lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value, it reads.\n\nNow it seems to me that it was late enough where Colbert doesnt have to worry about anything. But even if they find against him, he just faces a fine. I think we should always be vigilant against government fascism, this aint it. This is just hurting liberal feeeeeelings.",

      "title": "The Color Revolution Continues In Macedonia", 
      "text": "Macedonia may at first seem an unlikely target of the Anglo-American color revolution apparatus, but the truth is that the small country is now the latest battleground in a proxy war between Russia and the West. Not only are the two sides competing for influence over the domestic affairs and political decisions of the Macedonian government, there is also the question of geopolitical positions and the agenda of the creation of micro-states and mini-states. Most notably, however, is the interest regarding the Balkan Stream pipeline (aka the Turkish Stream Pipeline).\n\nThis is why mainstream media headlines have become inflamed with reports of social unrest in Macedonia over the past few weeks.\n\nIn order to understand what is actually happening, however, one needs to understand the timeline of events that have taken place in Macedonia since 2015 and continuing on to today as well as the nature of the various players involved in the political and physical street battles.\n\nIn May 2015, protests began erupting in Skopje, Macedonia against the Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski and his government. The protests, led by Zoran Zaev, were allegedly in response to the massive spying and surveillance of Macedonian officials and other individuals as well as an alleged cover-up of a killing of a young man by police in 2011. The protests were largely focused on the issue of government corruption, with tens of thousands of people in the streets of Skopje, demanding the Prime Ministers resignation as well as that of other members of his government.\n\nA major protest occurred on May 5 and several other anti-government protests have taken place since then. While some protests remained peaceful, there was widespread violence from other demonstrations. On the May 5 protest alone, violent clashes took place between protesters and police with injuries taking place on both sides.\n\nIn the days that followed, several Macedonian ministers resigned from their posts, including the Interior Minister. Prime Minister Gruevski, however, refused to resign, characterizing such a move as cowardly behavior.\n\nOn May 17, thousands of protesters once again descended upon the streets of Skopje to demand the ouster of the current government. On May 18, thousands more took to the streets to protest in support of the current government and Prime Minister Gruevski.\n\nAn anti-government, anti-Gruevski camp was set up outside government offices with several hundred inhabitants on average.\n\nIn December 2016, both major parties (VMRO-DPMNE, Gruevskis party and the Social Democrats, SDSM, the opposition party) won an almost identical number of seats in the Macedonian Parliament.\n\nThe Social Democrats managed to gain a parliamentary majority by virtue of forming a coalition with other parties supported by the relatively sizeable ethnic-Albanian majority. The Social Democrats, however, have been unable to form a government because the VMRO-DPMNE has effectively blocked them from doing so.\n\nNot only the Prime Minister Gruevski, but the President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, has acted to prevent the SDSM from obtaining its official mandate by refusing to give his approval to the process. In addition, VMRO MPs have been staging filibusters for almost five months.\n\nIvanov stated that the Social Democrats were threatening the countrys unity by promoting a number of concessions to the ethnic-Albanians. For this reason, he said, he could not allow them to take office. The coalition has attempted to force the President to something by electing a new parliamentary speaker. The Social Democrats are claiming that Ivanovs concerns over ethnic issues are simply a distraction to prevent the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nVMRO member and interim Foreign Minister, Nikola Poposki, has reassured the public that peaceful transfers will take place. The majority should rule and I dont think this will be prevented, he said. But we need credible reassurances that foreign agendas and federalisation are not going to happen.\n\nThe political impasse has resulted in major demonstrations throughout Skopje both by supporters of the Gruevski government and opposition to it. Demonstrators have clashed with each other, police, and even with lawmakers and members of parliament themselves.\n\nCorrupt as he and his party might be, however, the Gruevski faction has a legitimate concern in regards to foreign agendas and federalization.\n\nWhile Bechev attempts to present the actions of the VMRO-DPMNE supporters as simply stemming from xenophobia, the fact is that many of them are well aware of the foreign tentacles wrapped around their country.\n\nGeorge Soros is most well known for playing a major role in the funding and facilitating of the Bulldozer Revolution in Serbia that overthrew Slobodan Milosevic in 2000, Georgias Rose Revolution of 2003, the 2006 push to move Turkey toward a more Islamist governing structure, and even the Occupy movement in the United States among a great many others  none of which brought anything other than greater misery, impoverishment, and police state mechanisms to bear on the general public. The Occupy movement, being the only exception, still brought nothing to its participants except the opportunity to burn off excess anger and energy along with a few cracked protester skulls. It was otherwise an incredible waste of time.\n\nIn addition, George Soros has been heavily involved in the social unrest and movement-wrecking activity that has taken place all across the United States. From Florida to Ferguson and then on to Baltimore, George Soros Foundations have been involved in making sure that not only are American citizens unable to overcome racial divisions with mutual cooperation but that even the racially isolated participants are unable to accomplish anything of substance.\n\nIn Macedonia, like in the United States, Soros organizations work under the pretense of left cover. In other words, Soros NGOs fund and operate organizations and movements that are seen as left in nature but are, in reality, revolutionary organizations designed to push a political agenda, change Macedonian culture, install puppet regimes, and ultimately serve the purpose of the Anglo-American oligarchy.\n\nGeorge Soros most well-known NGO, Open Society Institute, is highly active in Macedonia and itself works with a plethora of civil society organizations throughout the country that function as the OSI (and hence the Wests) tentacles in Macedonian society. This is what has prompted some in Macedonia to say in regards to Soros that Soros came into Macedonia like a Trojan horse, and now he is an octopus.\n\nThe OSI has been active in Macedonia for some time, with Vladimir Milcin heading the organization for nearly twenty years. Milcin was a former police informant in the days of Communism. Milcin was instrumental in ratting out a dissident actor Risto Siskov.\n\nThe Soros networks in Macedonia are extremely powerful. As Jay Nordlinger reported for the National Review after having traveled to Macedonia,\n\nThat being said, it should be pointed out that Macedonian news outlets like Telma and 24 Vesti are both major players in promoting the anti-government protests (in addition to other operations). Both of these outlets are funded by George Soros.\n\nIndeed, even opposition leader Zoran Zaev is a notorious Soros-funded agent with close connections to the CIA. Not only Zaev, but his entire Social Democratic Union of Macedonia (SDSM) party (the former Communist party) has been entirely taken over by the Soros machine. As Wayne Madsen writes,\n\nWayne Madsen further describes the role of Victoria Nuland by writing:\n\nThe unapologetic foul-mouthed Nuland met on the side of the 51st Munich Security Conference in Germany with Macedonian Foreign Minister Nikola Poposki and President Gjorge Ivanov to express her displeasure at Gruevskis insurrection charges against her friend Zaev and his SDSM co-conspirators. Earlier, Nuland had offered to mediate a long-standing dispute between Greece and Macedonia over the latters use of the name Macedonia, which some Greeks consider to be a solely Greek name. Macedonian observers viewed Nulands interest in the name dispute to be a trap that would enable a pro-U.S. government, along with the Zionist and global banker baggage that comes with any such themed coup detat, to seize power in Skopje. Nuland and her co-conspirators were hoping for a replay of Kiev in what can be termed Kiev Version 2.0. Nuland and her co-conspirators in Skopje are alarmed over the speed at which the Macedonian security services rounded up the coup plotters. Macedonian police, in raids conducted in Skopje and Veles, seized five laptop computers, three desktop computers, 19 mobile phones, 100 CDs and DVDs, 17 hard disks, and 9 savings deposit books used by the coup plotters, including a number linked to Soros-financed NGOs. The bank accounts of the plotters reportedly were flush with healthy cash deposits from the CIA as the date of the planned coup approached. The use of social media by the Soros/CIA coup plotters should come as no surprise. Social media served at the very core of the themed revolutions sponsored by the CIA and Soros twice in Ukraine (Orange Revolution and Euro-Maidan uprising), Jasmine Revolution (Tunisia), Lotus Revolution (Egypt), Rose Revolution (Georgia), Tulip Revolution (Kyrgyszstan), and Green Revolution (Iran). In the case of Macedonia, there are clear indications that the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State in the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (DRL) Thomas Melia, responsible for DRLs work in Europe, including Russia, as well as the Middle East and North Africa, conspired directly with Zaev to mount a coup against the Gruevski government. Melia is the former deputy director of Freedom House, a Cold War-era neoconservative bevvy of U.S. war hawks based in New York. Although founded in 1941 by such progressives as Eleanor Roosevelt, Ralph Bunche, journalist Dorothy Thompson, novelist Rex Stout (creator of Nero Wolfe), and Republican presidential candidate Wendell Willkie (who would be considered by todays Republicans in the U.S. as a stark-raving liberal), Freedom House has devolved into a neoconservative chatter source having employed as their board members in recent years such war hawk cretins as Paul Wolfowitz, Ken Adelman, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Donald Rumsfeld, and Otto Reich. Freedom House has been caught red-handed funneling CIA money to opposition groups in Iran, Sudan, Russia, and China. In essence, Freedom House, like Soross NGOs, serves as a conduit for CIA support for rebellious opposition forces in dozens of countries around the world, countries that now include Macedonia, as well as Hungary, Venezuela, Syria, Egypt, Serbia, Jordan, Mexico, and Cuba.\n\nIn addition, it has been reported by a number of media outlets, most notably the Russian and Macedonian press, that George Soros has tapped into the Canvas network, enlisting the organization to help in Macedonian protests.\n\nCanvas members have managed to get themselves permanently banned from ever entering Russia, but they are welcome in the Macedonian capital. Soros Open Society Institute and the CIA via its fronts (PNAC, NED, USAid) have hired Canvas to do work in Macedonia. Canvas issued a memo to Macedonian students (three weeks prior to protests) that they would award the two best protest ideas with $1,500. The ideas were sent to Sonja Ismail, daughter of Guner Ismail, a popular SDSM member and official. Macedonia Online further describes the Canvas organization by stating the following: The gang pretending to be NGOs and trained to overthrow Governments and stage Coups around the world is paying $1,500 for ideas how to better organize demonstrations, reports Vecer. That gang is Soros Open Society Institute, USAid (Front for the CIA) and the Forum Group (another Soros NGO). This group has already backed and financed not just the Macedonian opposition SDSM, but their activists & protests, dating back to 2011. Serbian based Canvas led by Srgja Popovic who specializes in demonstrations has been hired both by Soros and the CIA to help in Macedonia. Canvas has gained quite the notoriety. Namely, the UAE has listed Canvas in the same ranks as Al-Qaeda, it is the only non-muslim terrorist organization! Canvas and Srgja Popovic were instrumental in bringing chaos to Ukraine (look at Ukraine today) and in removing Egypts Hosni Mubarak from power (look at Egypt now). Canvas first earned its notoriety for bringing down Milosevic. But it didnt stop there. Canvas was repeatedly hired by the CIA to organize protests in Gruzia, Moldavia, the Maldives, Lebanon, Egypt, Ukraine.... Canvas first appeared in Macedonia in 2009, when it became apparent the SDSM will be in opposition once again. The thug for hire himself Srgja Popovic was present in Ohrid to christen the opening of a Canvas Academy where future protesters and activists would be trained and be called upon when the time is right. Who was the financier of this academy? USAID and Soros. Soros employees Gjuner Ismail and Sasho Ordanovski were the promoters. Students were paid and agrgresively trained on how to protest in December of 2014 and January of 2015. Srgja Popovic himself showed up and met with Zaev in March, April and early May 2015. On May 6th Canvas (SDSM) activists violently attacked policemen, injuring 38, reported Vecer. Canvas was heavily involved in the death of Russian opposition leader Nemtsov, just few days before the opposition protest. The goal was to destabilize the situation, create internal conflict. But most Russian saw through the orchestrated murder for what it was, an ordered hit. When one takes into account the wife of Canvas leader worked at Stratfor (another CIA front), then things become clear, says Vecer. Prior to Canvas, Serbia had another group created by undercover NGOs. It was called Otpor, financed by Freedom House, another front for the CIA. Even the UN investigated Freedom House for their ties to the CIA. Members of Otpor have today joined the ranks of Canvas.\n\nMacedonia Online only echoes a report written by Tony Cartalucci of Land Destroyer Report in 2011 entitled CIA Coup-College, where Cartalucci exposed Canvas by writing:\n\nWhile the justification for the 2015 protests was presented as a wiretapping and surveillance scandal, there is a great deal of question as to who actually surveilled whom. For instance, while the Western and Soros-funded press is clear that the Macedonian government wiretapped the opposition and additional officials, other evidence suggests that it was the other way around and that the opposition actually wiretapped members of the Macedonian government.\n\nFor instance, as NPR has reported with the certainty of Macedonian governments guilt,\n\nBut, as Wayne Madsen points out, the true nature of the wiretapping scandal may be more complicated than what is being presented in the Western media. In fact, it may have been the opposition who was responsible for the wiretapping to begin with. Madsen writes,\n\nMacedonia unfortunately finds itself in an ethnically and nationalistically susceptible state. Since its formation in 1991, Macedonia has found itself at odds with Greece and Bulgaria (two bordering states) over a naming and territorial controversy as well as with Kosovo, Serbia, and Albania (three other bordering states) in regards to ethnic Albanians, from whom a movement has emerged that often flirts with separation. While the Albanians are a minority in Macedonia, they are about 25% of the population according to some statistics, large enough to cause a stir when agitated. Because these Albanians mostly live near the Albania-Kosovo border, they can be tempted to push for a greater Albania on the same model as the Kurds inhabiting Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Turkey push for a Kurdistan.\n\nIn addition, because of the firm grip that George Soros and his networks have on the Macedonian media, it is much easier to disseminate a certain viewpoint to the population than in a country with competing viewpoints. This is especially relevant when one considers that the total population of Macedonia is only about 2 million people, thus making the goal of reaching the majority of the population with that message a possibility that is all the more real.\n\nJournalist and geopolitical analyst, Andrew Korybko, describes the situation on the ground inside Macedonia as ripe for a color revolution precisely because of these elements, also pointing out that\n\nWhile geopolitical positioning, geostrategic jostling, and the desire for political influence are most certainly reasons for the destabilization of the Macedonian government, the most acute issue regarding Macedonia is the question of the Balkan Stream Pipeline (aka the Turkish Stream Pipeline).\n\nThe Balkan Stream, of course, is a Russian restart of the South Stream Pipeline, which would have stretched from Russia through the Black Sea to Bulgaria to Serbia, Hungary, Slovenia, and Austria. The oil and gas would then have been delivered to Europe. This project was abandoned after Bulgaria was bullied by the EU (and the United States) into reneging on its promise to participate.\n\nThe Balkan Stream is now a plan to take that Russian gas and oil from Russia and bring it through Turkey, into Greece, Macedonia, Serbia, Hungary, and into Austria. It will be a replacement for the South Stream pipeline and an alternate route to provide oil and gas to Europe, particularly now that the decision has been made to begin bypassing Ukraine in 2019.\n\nCurrently, Russia provides Europe with about 30% (or 1/3) of its energy. This provides not only the obvious benefits of profits and services to both countries but it also ensures that Russia has Europe over a barrel, the EU being dependent upon the oil and gas rich nation for a wide variety of energy sources. Thus, it ensures dependence upon Russia and thus better (theoretically) international conduct between the two countries if for no other reason than the EU would be hesitant to provoke Russia for fear of having its oil and gas cut off.\n\nThe US and NATO have been frantically trying to remove this leverage over Europe by attempting to sabotage oil pipelines in the Middle East that might benefit Iran in favor of oil deals that would benefit Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and other Gulf State feudal monarchies, all essentially satellites of the Anglo-American oligarchy. It is precisely why the US was so adamantly opposed to Bulgarias participation in the South Stream project.\n\nOf course, it is also important to point out that the question of the creation of micro-states and mini states on the Brzezinski model is, as always, readily present. This method is essentially both a strategy of tension and a goal of creating a world where previously united nations are reduced to petty impotent and squabbling pseudo-states incapable of standing up to any major government, corporation, or bank. Likewise, a planet of peoples who are incapable of viewing anything other than the convenient scapegoat given to them by the world oligarchy will be incapable of resisting the power and will of that oligarchy. In the absence of a fully formed micro state, the ability to use poorly drawn borders, ethnic conflicts, racial tension, and religious fundamentalism/antagonism provides this oligarchy with the ability to play national governments and their populations like a fiddle.\n\nThe attempt to present the Macedonian color revolution as the legitimate will of the Macedonian people  as in Syria, Libya, Ukraine, and others  can easily be disproven by talking with Macedonians. Unlike Western audiences, the Macedonian public is somewhat more hesitant to believe their billionaire owned media outlets.\n\nIf speaking with Macedonians is not convincing enough, one can simply witness the massive pro-government demonstrations that have taken place in response to the anti-government protests. For instance, on May 18, 2015 tens of thousands of Macedonians marched in Skopje expressing support for Prime Minister Gruevski and the Macedonian government. Indeed, the protesters that stormed the Parliament and attacked parliamentarians were pro-Gruevski protesters, angry at what they see as foreign interference, division, identity politics, and cultural Marxism being pushed by the Social Democrats. These marches and protests, however, should not be interpreted as love for the government and its politicians so much as a response to the obvious color revolution apparatus at work inside their country. It is more of a statement of rejection of outside influence in Macedonian domestic affairs than support for the status quo.\n\nThe unrest taking place across Macedonia over the last few weeks as well as over the past two years and currently bringing tens of thousands of Macedonians out into the streets is the result of a deployment of the Western-engineered color revolution apparatus designed to destabilize and overthrown the Macedonian government, who has agreed to work with Russia to build the Balkan Stream pipeline through the country. This color revolution, created and deployed by Western governments, NATO, and the Soros networks of NGOs, foundations, and civil society groups is an attempt to remove any leverage Russia may have over the EU and to expand the hegemony of the world oligarchy.\n\nBrandon Turbeville  article archive here  is the author of seven books, Codex Alimentarius  The End of Health Freedom, 7 Real Conspiracies, Five Sense Solutions and Dispatches From a Dissident, volume 1 and volume 2, The Road to Damascus: The Anglo-American Assault on Syria, The Difference it Makes: 36 Reasons Why Hillary Clinton Should Never Be President, and Resisting The Empire: The Plan To Destroy Syria And How The Future Of The World Depends On The Outcome.

      "title": "BREAKING : As Trump-Russia Story Crumbles, Media Ignores the ELEPHANT in the Room", 
      "text": "As the fake news Russia story continues to crumble into tear-soaked flakes of liberal dust, the mainstream media is doing their best to ignore the GIANT elephant in the room.\n\nOur lying liberal media has spent months reporting on a story that has ZERO evidence.\n\nThey have treated the fake Russia story as if it were the SCANDAL OF THE  CENTURY, all the while ignoring the real scandal  Obama grossly abusing his power, likely committing a whole host of federal crimes, and placing American citizens under surveillance just for political kicks.\n\nGee, that sounds like an actual story, complete with evidence and everything.\n\nHowever, that story does not suit their liberal narrative, so theyll spend their time making up stories that do.\n\nAnd that boys and girls, is why our liberal media is 100% FAKE NEWS.\n\nThe Mainstream media are watching their Russia election-meddling narrative teeter on the brink of collapse. Theyre holding their collective breath hoping it doesnt topple over, like the worlds highest stakes game of Jenga.\n\nEvery week the Russia story crumbles a bit more. Whether it is the loss of credibility of Crowdstrikes hacking report, or the revelation by WikiLeaks that the CIA can make a cyber attack look like it came from wherever they want, the leftist media cant catch a break. The FBI and NSA have both testified that there is no evidence that there was any hacking of actual voting, and the WikiLeaks allegations throw doubt on Russias involvement in hacking the DNC or Podesta emails. Even if they did, the media and the Democrats still have yet to convince anyone that the emails are the reason that voters chose Trump in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Despite this, the media zealously chase after every angle of the story, mostly using anonymous sources and individuals familiar with the investigation.\n\nWell, they chase almost every angle on the Russia story  except for the very real connections between the Clinton campaign and Russia.\n\nThe media keep the Russia story at the presidential level, failing to provide any sort of context for Trumps win. The Democrats lost more than 1,000 seats at the federal and state level during Obamas presidency, including 9 Senate seats, 62 House seats, 12 governorships, and a startling 958 state legislative seats. Did the Russians have a hand in all of those elections? Or are those election results clear signals of Americas shift away from Obama and Clinton, who promised to be a third Obama term?\n\nWhile they continue to desperately push stories about Russia, the mainstream media remain practically silent on the story they should be focusing on  the surveillance of Donald Trump and his campaign staff by the Obama administration. Unless the media want to portray Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) as a paranoid schizophrenic (Breitbart News wouldnt put it past them), we now have strong indications that President Obama and his staff surveilled Trump and staff. This may or may not have been illegal, but certainly was cheating by any definition.\n\nThe revelations about this spying are coming fast and thick. On Thursday, Kimberly Strassel outlined some of the key allegations in The Wall Street Journal:\n\nFirst, there were dozens of documents with information about Trump officials. Second, the information these documents contained was not related to Russia. Third, while many reports did mask identities (referring, for instance, to U.S. Person 1 or 2) they were written in ways that made clear which Trump officials were being discussed. Fourth, in at least one instance, a Trump official other than Mr. Flynn was outright unmasked. Finally, these documents were circulated at the highest levels of government.\n\nMore news is already breaking on on the unmasking front  Susan Rice, Obamas national security adviser, has been reported as the official who requested the unmasking. This followed a Fox News report that a very senior official had made the requests. The headlines about Rice began following a post by Mike Cernovich naming her, along with broadcasts by him on Periscope, Twitters video streaming application.\n\nThe medias response to this story was immediate. Unfortunately, it wasnt the response wed hope for  a hard-hitting investigation into why Americans were under surveillance completely unrelated to questions about Russian connections. Instead, the media have been attacking Nunes with everything theyve got.\n\nAmy Moreno is a Published Author, Pug Lover & Game of Thrones Nerd. You can reach her on Facebook here.",

      "text": "Fresno State University in California says an American history professor who tweeted that President Donald Trump 'must hang' will be on paid leave for the rest of the semester.\n\nThe university says in a statement Tuesday that professor Lars Maischak has taken a voluntary leave of absence for the remainder of the spring semester.\n\nMaischak could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nLast week, Maischak apologized for tweeting: 'To save American democracy, Trump must hang. The sooner and the higher, the better.'\n\nFar-right websites such as Breitbart News highlighted the tweet, sparking angry calls on social media for the professor to be fired.\n\nThe university declined to say if Maischak would be back to teach in the fall, saying it was continuing to review the case.\n\nMaischak said last week he has temporarily left Fresno while the university is on spring break, after receiving death threats and hundreds of hate emails.\n\n'I regret making these tweets,' Maischak said. 'I wrote them to an audience of 28 followers on Twitter under the assumption they would be read by people I know.'\n\nMaischak said he sent the tweet in February to voice personal despair over comments by Trump and actions by the current US government and was not trying to incite violence.\n\nThe tweet said: 'To save American democracy, Trump must hang. The sooner and the higher, the better. #TheResistance #DeathToFascism.'\n\nBreitbart posted an article Saturday saying the tweet and others on Maischak's account showed opinions that 'explain why universities across the country are now viewed with disdain by the average, salt-of-the-earth Americans.'\n\nMaischak deleted his Twitter account on Wednesday and said he is prepared to take full responsibility for his statements.\n\nFresno State has distanced itself from the comments, saying they reflect Maischak's personal views and not those of the university.\n\nUniversity President Joseph Castro said he appreciated Maischak's apology, calling it 'a first good step' in calming critics, the Fresno Bee reported.\n\nThe university was committed to free speech and was taking the matter seriously, Castro said.\n\nHe said officials had contacted federal authorities, adding his main concern is the safety of students and the campus community.",

      "text": "Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the Trump administration's national security team warned Congress Wednesday of the growing threat posed by North Korea, and said they would be increasing pressure on China to rein in the rogue nation.\n\n\"This is an extremely difficult situation, one of the most difficult I have ever seen,\" Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, a member of the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committees, said after senators returned from the meeting. Senators met administration officials in an office building adjoining the White House.\n\nLawmakers would not provide specific details because the talks were classified, but said the discussion centered on non-military steps that could be taken to reduce the increasing threat that North Korea will use nuclear weapons in the region and eventually, the United States.\n\n\"The timeline is getting shorter for them to develop a nuclear weapon that they could deliver here,\" said Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn. \"And you already know they have nuclear weapons.\"\n\nPresident Trump attended the briefing but gave only introductory remarks to the lawmakers, they said. The rest of the meeting was conducted by Tillerson and Trump's national security team, who received high praise from senators in both parties.\n\n\"One of the strong impressions I came away with is what a good national security team we have,\" said King, who votes with Democrats.\n\n\"I'm convinced [the administration] understand[s] the threat,\" said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. \"They've established a strategic approach to a very difficult situation.\"\n\nSen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., said the talks centered around the \"serious\" and \"large concern\" posed by North Korea and the non-military actions that could deter them from further development of their nuclear weapons program.\n\n\"There are so many options that need to be taken that are a long way away from a strike,\" Gardner said. \"There are a number of diplomatic options that can be taken that include secondary sanctions against Chinese individuals, entities and companies that are doing business with North Korea.\"\n\nSuch measures, Gardner said, would pressure the Chinese to \"work in good faith\" to get North Korea to back off on its aggression.\n\n\"The road to a denuclearized North Korea goes directly through Beijing and that is what we have to focus on,\" Gardner said.\n\nThe administration, Gardner said, did not discuss returning the country to the list of state sponsors of terrorism. Gardner, along with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, have introduced legislation to re-list North Korea.\n\n\"It's a serious threat,\" Rubio said. \"Not many easy options.\"",

      "title": "Trump shatters fundraising record with $107 million for inauguration", 
      "text": "Organizers announced the total on Tuesday, two days before the 58th Presidential Inaugural Committee must disclose its donors to the Federal Election Commission. The money paid for 20 events during the extravaganza, but produced excess cash that will be donated in the future to a charity, organizers said. They declined to share the details of the gift or the recipient.\n\n\"The amount of funds raised for the inaugural celebration allowed the President to give the American people, those both at home and visiting Washington, a chance to experience the incredible moment in our democracy where we witness the peaceful transition of power, a cornerstone of American democracy,\" said Tom Barrack, a close friend of Trump's who oversaw the ceremony.\n\nBarack Obama's historic first inauguration collected a net of $53 million in 2009; Obama's team took in $44 million in 2013.\n\nTrump struggled to raise large sums of money for much of the campaign, though the report shows a large number of traditional donors and companies in recent months making amends by funding his inauguration.\n\nTwenty-six donors gave at least $1 million to the committee, including a $5 million donation from Las Vegas casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. Other seven-digit donors included the owners of four NFL teams: Bob McNair of the Houston Texans, Shahid Khan of the Jacksonville Jaguars, Dan Snyder of the Washington Redskins and Robert Kraft of the New England Patriots, who visit the White House on Wednesday to recognize their Super Bowl victory this year. The report also shows the influence of large corporations, who cannot give directly to candidates during the campaign: Bank of America, Pfizer, Boeing, Dow Chemical and AT&T each gave $1 million to support Trump during the lead-up to the inauguration. Other donors include some people who were once critical of Trump but may now seek a better relationship with the White House, including New York fundraiser Paul Singer, who once predicted Trump would trigger a global recession but gave him $1 million in early December. This report does not show what the committee disbursed, meaning how much cash it has on hand -- which theoretically would be donated to charity -- is currently unknown.",

But current and former FBI officials told NBC News late Thursday that it was Trump, not Comey, who requested the dinner, and that in any event Comey would never divulge whether the president was being investigated.\n\nComey has not spoken publicly since his firing, and Trump did not indicate why he thinks it is necessary to head off any \"leaking\" from the former FBI chief. The president also did not indicate who he believes may have recorded the two men's conversation.\n\nThe District of Columbia has a \"one-party consent\" law, meaning it is not a crime to tape a phone call or conversation as long as one person in the conversation is aware that he or she is being recorded.\n\nThe White House has drawn criticism for the timing of Comey's firing, which occurred as the FBI continued to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible connections with the Trump campaign.",

This is a total lie. The Ribbon was first introduced to Russia in 1769, long before Karl Marx was even born. It has become a symbol deeply associated with the victory over fascism only in post-Soviet times.\n\nIn recent years, disgusting episodes of veterans  being attacked by neo-Nazis have become an increasingly common occurrence.\n\nBy contrast, the Kiev regime sponsors celebrations of Ukrainian Nazis like Stepan Bandera.\n\nIf you have a personal video of fascist attacks in veterans in Ukraine, The Duran wants to hear from you.

      "title": "General McMaster provides technical corroboration for Russian version of Syrian gas attack", 
      "text": "Shortly after the alleged chemical weapons attack on Khan Sheikhoun in Syria the Russian Defence Ministry claimed that the release of chemical agents following the air strike happened because the Syrian air force struck a warehouse where the Jihadis were producing and storing stockpiles of chemical weapons.\n\nThis explanation was widely ridiculed, especially in Britain.  A good summary is provided in this article on Counterpunch, with the comment by Bellingcat referred to in the article available here.  I shall quote the relevant section from the first article in Counterpunch since it provides a good summary\n\nI am not an expert on the production or storage of chemical weapons.  However I recall that in one of her speeches to Goldman Sachs leaked by Wikileaks Hillary Clinton (who as a former US Secretary of State would presumably know) said the following, which does not seem to sit very comfortably with the claims of the British experts cited above\n\nHowever I was even more interested to read this largely overlooked comment of General H.R. McMaster, President Trumps National Security Adviser, spoken during his joint press conference with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in the immediate aftermath of the Sharyat air base missile strike\n\nQ    And on the target, anything else on specifically what you believe was destroyed in the strike? GENERAL McMASTER:  Ill defer to the Pentagon on that.  But there were a number of targets that were associated with the ability of that airfield to operate and to continue mass-murder attacks against the Syrian civilians.  And the one thing that I will tell you, though, there was an effort to minimize risk to third-country nationals at that airport  I think you read Russians from that  and we took great pains to try to avoid that.  Of course, in any kind of military operation, there are no guarantees.  And then there were also measures put in place to avoid hitting what we believe is a storage of sarin gas there so that that would not be ignited and cause a hazard to civilians or anyone else.\n\nMaybe I am missing something but it seems to me that General McMaster here is saying that when carrying out the missile strike on Sharyat air base the US took precautions to avoid precisely the sort of scenario which the Russians say actually happened following the Syrian air strike on Khan Sheikhoun, but which Colonel Hamish de Bretton-Gordon says is fanciful.\n\nI appreciate that the Bellingcat comment quoted above refers to the manufacturing process for sarin gas, and I have no reason to doubt that dropping a bomb on the binary components does not actually provide the correct mechanism for making the nerve agent.  However the Russian report quite clearly refers to the manufacturing and storage of chemical weapons at the bombed warehouse, and it is of course precisely the hazard to civilians caused by hitting what we believe is a storage of sarin gas that General McMaster said the US sought to avoid.\n\nThe Bellingcat article makes further claims about the Jihadis supposed lack of capacity to produce sarin gas and the supposed inability of both the Jihadis and of the Syrian military to produce sarin gas with a long shelf life.  However UN investigators have previously said that Jihadi groups have used sarin gas during the Syrian war, and the technical premises of the Bellingcat claims in relation to Jihadi production of sarin gas have also been comprehensively challenged by this detailed discussion in the Who Attacked Ghouta site, which not only suggests how the Jihadis might produce sarin gas but which shows how they might do so at a reasonable cost.\n\nIf it was only Hillary Clinton who was saying that an attack on a chemical storage facility might pose a hazard to civilians then at a pinch I would be prepared to accept that as a civilian she might be wrong.\n\nHowever I refuse to accept that this is so of General McMaster.  As a military officer with the resources of the US National Security Council behind him he surely knows what he is talking about.\n\nFrankly, in light of what General McMaster said about the Sharyat air base attack, the Russian version of the Khan Sheikhoun attack does not seem to me fanciful at all.",

      "text": "It was one of the most horrifying attacks weve seen out of the Syrian civil war so far: a nerve gas attack, possibly sarin, killing scores of people.\n\nAccording to Fox News, bombs containing the gas were dropped on the rebel-held province of Idlib on Tuesday. The U.K. Guardian reported that at least 70 people were killed in an obvious war crime.\n\nWe were attacked with four strikes, said Syrian journalist Hadi Abdullah, who talked to Fox News. When people went to help, they were choked with the poisoned gas.\n\nOf course, this wasnt the first time an attack like this had happened. In 2013, Bashar Assads government was accused of using chemical weapons, as well. Yet, in 2012, the Obama administration had said that the use of such weapons of mass destruction would be considered a red line.\n\nThat red line was crossed and nothing really happened. The Obama administration continued its policy of kind-of-sort-of helping rebel groups of dubious provenance without actually doing anything that would lead to either Assads ouster or ensure that Syrian government forces wouldnt use those weapons again.\n\nTRENDING: Trump Takes Second Swing at Pakistan, Shows $250 Million Cut Was Only the Beginning\n\nOn Tuesday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer pointed this out in a statement delivered during an off-camera briefing.\n\nTodays chemical attack in Syria against innocent people, including women and children, is reprehensible and cannot be ignored by the civilized world, Spicer said, according to Breitbart.\n\nThese heinous actions by the Bashar al-Assad regime are a consequence of the past administrations weakness and irresolution. President Obama said in 2012 that he would establish a red line against the use of chemical weapons and then did nothing. The United States stands, with our allies across the globe, to condemn this intolerable act.\n\nThe use of chemical weapons was, indeed, a red line that should have been dealt with long ago, before the Syrian conflict festered into what it has become. While we acknowledge that Syria is a difficult situation, direct action needs to be taken against those who use weapons of mass destruction.\n\nWe cannot glean from his initial statements what direction President Donald Trumps response will go, although, according to The Guardian, he said Wednesday that his attitude toward Syria and Assad has changed very much, and that with a chemical attack that (y)oure now talking about a whole different level.\n\nWe can only hope that his response isnt as ineffectual and disingenuous as Barack Obamas red line.

      "text": "Over the last couple weeks, Hillary Clintons longtime aide and friend Huma Abedin has been in the news, and for a good reason. If you havent heard, late last week the State Department released a ton of emails discovered on Abedins estranged husband, and convicted pedophile, Anthony Weiner near the end of the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nNow, if you remember correctly, these are the very same emails that prompted former disgraced FBI Director James Comey to reopen an investigation into Hillary Clinton that ended right before the November election. Of course, Hillary and her buddies all claimed that these emails were nothing, and it was just a ploy by conservatives to sway the election, but that appears to be far from the truth after what was just discovered.\n\nPresident Trump made waves late last week again when he tweeted that Huma Abedin should be in jail for using her personal, unsecured Yahoo email to forward highly sensitive State Department emails that included passwords to government systems.\n\nAccording to The Daily Caller, Abedin who was Clintons top aide when she served as Secretary of State would often forward highly sensitive government emails to her unsecured server to print out these documents which fell prey to hackers from 2014-2016. Of course, this breach of protocol would get anyone of us thrown behind bars, but because she is a Clinton crony, Huma has been able to remain free, but that may about to change after Abedin was caught in one hell of a nasty lie.\n\nNew evidence has been discovered on Huma Abedins pervert husbands computer, Anthony Weiner that shows she backed up copies of her emails with Hillary Clinton, and then lied to the FBI and in court that she did not preserve the conversations.\n\nI wonder how Huma will try and explain this one away?\n\nHere is more from The Daily Wire:\n\nHuma Abedin backed up copies of her emails with Hillary Clinton onto her husbands laptop, contrary to what she told the FBI and other officials investigating the email scandal, according to a new report.\n\nAbedin, Clintons top aide, backed up many of her work-related emails to Anthony Weiners laptop after Clinton left the State Department in early 2013, the Daily Mail writes after an examination of her emails.\n\nBut Abedin told the FBI that she lost most of her old emails as a result of the transition from the State Department.\n\nShe had only accessed clintonemail.com through a web portal and did not have a method for archiving her old emails prior to the transition, according to notes taken during an FBI interview with Abedin on April 5, 2016.\n\nAbedin compounded that statement in June 2016 by telling lawyers from a watchdog group under oath that she didnt back up emails.\n\nWith respect to those State Department work-related emails on the Clintonemail.com accounts, what did you do, if anything, to preserve those emails? asked an attorney with Judicial Watch, according to a transcript of the deposition.\n\nAbedin said she did not do anything to preserve those emails.\n\nThe instances where it was Clinton email to Clinton email, there were instances where the content of those emails had personal matters in there, and there may have also been State Department matters in there, too. It was a  a combination. But I did not  I did not preserve those e-mails, Abedin said.\n\nClinton kept a secret email server in her New York home and used it to correspond with several top aides throughout her time as Secretary of State. Dozens of classified emails were found to have been forwarded through unsecured mail servers.\n\nLast week, Judicial Watch revealed, that there are at least 18 classified emails in the 798 documents recently produced by the State Department from the FBIs investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clintons elicit email system.\n\nAmong those, 13 contained classified information, including discussions about Saudi Arabia, The Hague, Egypt, South Africa, Zimbabwe, the identity of a CIA official, Malawi, the war in Syria, Lebanon, Hamas, and the PLO, Judicial Watch reported.\n\nThis new information discovered should be a big enough bargaining chip for investigators to use to push for some answers. If Huma Abedin were smart, she would start talking and get herself the lesser of the deal since the big fish we all want to see fry is Hillary Clinton.\n\nIt appears that President Trump is keeping his promise to drain the swamp and if we are so blessed, we may see Hillary Clinton and her associates in jail soon. For too long these disgusting individuals have gotten away with destroying our country and putting Americans in harms way. It is past the time for these traitors to finally serve the sentence they deserve and we can all hope and pray that Trump does it before the year is out.\n\nFOLLOW us on Facebook at Freedom Daily!",

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) since moving to silence her on the Senate floor in February, Warren told The Boston Globe.\n\nMcConnell cut Warren off in February as she tried to read a letter from Coretta Scott King during a speech on the Senate floor, explaining her opposition to Jeff Sessions nomination to be attorney general. McConnell invoked a little-used rule that blocks senators by any form of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator.\n\nEven though Sessions was eventually confirmed and two months have passed since the incident, the relationship between the two senators still remains frosty.\n\nIve spoken to him, but he has not spoken to me, Warren told the Globe in an interview published Saturday. I say hello to Mitch every chance I get, and he turns his head.\n\nBut Don Stewart, a spokesman for McConnell, said he couldnt comment on Warrens claims. Ive never witnessed that and have never seen her approach him so Im afraid I cant be much help, he said.\n\nAfter the February incident, McConnell said that Warren had been warned she could be cut off.\n\nSen. Warren was giving a lengthy speech. She had appeared to violate the rule. She was warned. She was given an explanation, McConnell said. Nevertheless, she persisted. The latter phrase immediately took off on social media as a progressive rallying cry.\n\nWarrens interview with the Globe came as she promoted her new book, This Is Our Fight. In the book, Warren, frequently mentioned as a Democratic candidate for the White House, says she considered running for president in 2016, but decided not to after her husband told her that the campaign would be worse than her 2012 run for Senate.",

      "text": "Hillary Clinton was so arrogant during the general election that she didnt even bother having a concession speech prepared. And now, even after being soundly defeated, she just cant deal with it. Not content with working together with the administration for the betterment of the country, she has instead decided to become an obstacle. Will someone buy this woman a goldfish or something? Keep her busy...\n\nIn the following video, Right Wing News looks at recent reports detailing how Hillary Clinton is building a group called Onward Together, whose sole purpose is to fund organizations working on the resistance to President Donald Trumps agenda. This sort of desperation shown by Clinton is so pathetic its almost sad; when will she ever learn?\n\nFailed Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, considered by some to be the sorest loser in history, has reportedly begun constructing a new resistance-themed political group whose sole purpose will be to fund the antics of the nations legions of anti-Trump zealots.\n\nSlated to be launched as soon as next week and called Onward Together  an apparent nod to her campaign slogan, Stronger Together  the group will fund organizations working on the resistance to President Donald Trumps agenda, unnamed individuals reportedly close to Clinton told Politico Thursday.\n\nMoreover, Clinton has tapped her former campaign finance director, Dennis Cheng, who previously served as the Clinton Foundations chief development officer, to solicit new potential donors.\n\nLikewise, shes been working with former Democrat National Committee chairman, presidential candidate and Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, as well as Judith McHale, who served as her undersecretary during her tenure as secretary of state, to locate groups worth funding.\n\nAs noted by The Washington Times, Onward Together appears to just be another political fundraising outlet just like the Clinton Foundation  which last year shuttered some of its offshoots after an investigation by the FBI exposed the organizations illicit ways.\n\nIt also seems like a desperate attempt to stay relevant and obtain vengeance against her former election opponent, as pointed out by The Daily Wire contributor Michael Qazvini.\n\nSix months after her devastating loss to populist outsider Donald Trump, Clinton is developing what can only be described as a super PAC of sorts to seek revenge on the man who buried her political ambitions, Qazvini wrote.\n\nAnd raise lots and lots of money, of course.\n\nThe motivations suspected by Qazvini do make sense given that this news broke only days after Clinton delivered a pitiful spiel in which she again tried to pin the blame for her spectacular 2016 election loss to Trump on FBI Director James Comey, WikiLeaks and misogyny  basically everybody but herself.\n\nIn many ways, Clinton is like an ex who refuses to get over a breakup and instead obsesses over it day in and out.\n\nThe best way to deal with such people is to tell them that there are plenty of fish in the sea, but since there is pretty much zero chance that Clinton will ever become president of the United States, this line probably wouldnt work on her.",

      "title": "All the Pitfalls of the Latest Republican Health-Care Proposal", 
      "text": "President Trump desperately wants a deal on health care, and he wants the House to pass it next week before his first 100 days in the White House are out. That much is clear from the reports of a tentative agreement between the leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, and a co-chairman of the moderate Tuesday Group, Representative Tom MacArthur of New Jersey, to break a stalemate over the GOPs American Health Care Act. Whats also clear, however, is that the House Republican leadershipthe lawmakers that both call and count the votes in Congressshares neither the optimism nor the urgency of the White House. Speaker Paul Ryan said after a speech in London on Wednesday that Republicans were putting the finishing touches on a new proposal, after the party stumbled badly last month on its initial attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. But on Thursday, a senior GOP congressional aide dampened expectations for the bill, which a senior White House official told The Washington Post could receive a House vote as soon as the middle of next week. The question is whether it can get 216 votes in the House and the answer isnt clear at this time, the aide wrote me in an email. There is no legislative text and therefore no agreement to do a whip count on. These mixed signals are the latest example of the yawning expectations gap between Trump and Ryan over what Congress can achieve on the vexing question of health care. Reluctant to acknowledge defeat, the president has repeatedly insisted over the last several weeks that an agreement is close at hand, that the differences separating the hardliners in the Freedom Caucus from the more pragmatic and electorally vulnerable moderates are bridgeable. Its evolving, the president said Thursday during a press conference, in which he denied there was ever a give-up on the issue. (His top aides had told House Republicans that Trump would move on from health care if they didnt pass the bill last month.) The plan gets better and better and better, and its gotten really, really good, and a lot of people are liking it a lot, Trump said. We have a good chance of getting it soon.\n\nBut while Ryan has made a public show of confidence, his office has been much more skeptical about the prospects for reviving the AHCA, having seen first-hand how narrow the path is for writing a policy that can win the votes of conservatives without sacrificing the support of Republicans closer to the political center. Conservative activists also sense that the speaker is fearful of being burned again on a bill for which he expended significant political capital and lost. The basic dynamics havent changed: Members of the Freedom Caucus want to repeal more of Obamacares insurance mandates than the AHCA initially scrapped. They argue that doing so is central to the GOPs long-standing promise of a complete repeal and that the requirements that insurance companies cover certain essential health benefits and accept even the sickest customers are driving up premiums for millions of Americans. Moderates, however, are leery of breaking another pledge Republicans have made repeatedlythat they would not do away with Obamacares popular protections for people with preexisting conditions. As reported by The Huffington Post and Politico, the agreement Meadows and MacArthur have struck would deal with the mandates by letting the states opt out of many of them, so long as they demonstrated that an alternative policy would seek to lower premium costs and expand insurance coverage. In theory, the compromise would let conservatives declare they have weakened Obamacares mandates and given states more power over health-care policy. And moderates hailing from Democratic states could assure their constituents that, in all likelihood, they would not lose the protections they currently have because their governors or legislatures would not opt out of the federal mandates.\n\nBut the proposal faces any number of pitfalls, both practically and politically. Meadows, the third-term North Carolina conservative, genuinely wants to play the role of dealmaker. Despite the presidents occasional ribbing, hes on good terms with Trump and would like nothing more than to win his praise by delivering a health-care deal that once seemed dead. But it remains an open question just how much sway Meadows has with his own members in the Freedom Caucus. He has claimed that he could have delivered some two dozen votes for an earlier proposal from Vice President Mike Pence, but the House GOP leadership has privately voiced doubts about his influence. Its clear there are some members of the Freedom Caucus, such as Representative Justin Amash of Michigan, who are unlikely to support any bill that retains the structure of the AHCA. The GOP can lose no more than 22 votes, and a number of moderates are similarly opposed to the legislation because it goes too far to the right at it is. MacArthur may be a co-chairman of the Tuesday Group, but he was already supporting the House GOP bill, so his backing of a compromise doesnt automatically alter the dynamic on the center aisle of the Republican conference. The leadership was well short of the 216 votes it needed in March, and party officials have warned that just about any deal they struck with the Freedom Caucus would result in a net loss of votes because it would scare moderates away. MacArthurs endorsement could help prevent that kind of exodus, but its unlikely to flip many votes among the dozen or so moderates who were previously opposed.\n\nModerates have even more reason to be wary because conservatives are itching to lay the failure of Obamacare repeal at their feet after the Freedom Caucus drew the bulk of the blame last month. After Meadows endorsed Pences proposal in March, activist groups like Heritage Action and the Club for Growth attacked GOP centrists for blocking progress on the bill. Republicans in the White House and on Capitol Hill were plainly embarrassed by their failure on health care the first time around, when they abandoned an ironclad promise without so much as a vote. The whiff had a much bigger ripple effect on their agenda, threatening Trumps even higher priority of tax reform. But to political analysts, the idea that the president and the House GOP would revive the AHCA is akin to escaping a burning building and then rushing back in for no good reason. The original bill had a ghastly 17 percent approval rating and had virtually no natural constituency other than Democratic activists eager to make Republicans pay for supporting it. The legislation has continued to dominate town-hall events during the current congressional recess, prompting lawmakers who had been on the fence, like Representative Jeff Denham of California, to declare their opposition after the fact. Within hours of the reported agreement, statements denouncing the policy flooded in from progressive groups accusing Republicans of breaking their promise to people with preexisting conditions and trying to paper over their deceit. The MacArthur amendment makes a bad bill even worse, wrote the co-directors of Health Care for America Now, Margarida Jorge and Ethan Rome. The only people this amendment will help are the members of Congress scrambling to pass any repeal bill for partisan political reasons, no matter how bad it is for their constituents. Millions will still lose their health insurance. States can still avoid critical consumer protections. Insurers can still refuse to provide basic coverage, institute annual and lifetime caps on the care they cover, and charge people with preexisting conditions more just because they need care, effectively pricing people out of the market. Jessica Mackler, the president of American Bridge, called the idea of letting states opt out of Obamacare mandates an insidious backdoor to hammer individuals with preexisting conditions and ending coverage for essential services like hospitalization, maternity care, and prescription drugs.\n\nAs I wrote on Tuesday, Congress has a more urgent matter to consider when lawmakers return to Washington next week: Theyll have just a few days to avert a partial shutdown of the federal government. Funding expires on April 28, and the two parties have yet to announce a deal to appropriate money for the remaining five months of the fiscal year. At minimum, Congress must pass a stopgap measure to buy more time for negotiations if they want to keep the government open, and Republican leaders have said this will be their top priority in the days ahead. Asked on Thursday whether he wanted a vote on health care or on a funding deal next week, Trump replied: I want to get both. Are you shocked? Lest the president forget, the U.S. Congress is a bicameral legislature. Even if the House were to pass a major health-care bill in time for Trumps 100-day marker, the legislation would still be a long way from becoming law. The proposals prospects were already precarious with the narrow Republican majority in the Senate, and the changes under consideration in the House could further imperil it in the upper chamber. Passage in the House would likely spur another several weeks of negotiations, if not months. Trump may be impatient to demonstrate progress on health care, but as he learned when he initially tried to shoehorn a House vote last month, wishing Congress would do something doesnt make it so.",

      "text": "It kind of embarrasses me that we let a person risk his life for us and then kicked him out, Clinton said referring to Miguel Perez Jr., a legal United States resident who was sent back to Mexico for drug offenses.\n\nA guy that does two combat tours in Afghanistan, risks his life for the rest of us, Clinton said. Whether you approve of what were doing there or not, he did things that most Americans dont do. And he got taken off the street and sent home the other day.\n\nEarlier in his speech, Clinton made a play for gun control by using statistics to suggest that gun violence is a far greater threat than radical Islamic terrorism. Clinton said:\n\nNine-tenths of one percent of Americas population are Muslims. Two hundred and ten thousand people have been killed in gun violence since 911. The percentage of them killed by Muslims is less than three-tenths of one percent. In other words, their murder rate is one-third the national average. Does it mean we shouldnt be tough on terrorism committed by Islamic radicals? Of course not. But it means we shouldnt go around in a blind stupor mixing apples and oranges and terrifying some of the talented, most devoted people in this country who want to make their contribution and who help make us better, because diverse groups make better decisions and make a more interesting life.\n\nClinton also acknowledged that both the United States and the world were undergoing significant changes due to globalization, and he admitted that its consequences are often negative and mortify people.\n\nHe said, referring, for example, to the global ransom over hacking files:\n\nI think, for whatever its worth... I believe that this global interdependence, in the end, will turn out to be a good thing. But theres a lot of good and bad to it. You get on the Internet and do all kinds of searches and find things that are sometimes even true. But we also know that, like every other technological development, it is capable of bringing great good and great trouble.\n\nHe said, We should relish our differences and we should feel self-confident in doing so, because from a strictly biological point of view, genetically, we are about 99 percent the same; all of us on Planet Earth.\n\nClinton completed his speech by saying, Every single day we should each find a way to expand the definition of us and shrink the definition of them. Because, in the end, theres not enough difference to spend our life fretting about it.",

      "title": "Thousands turn out for March for Science in U.S. cities", 
      "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters)  Thousands of scientists and people from other walks of life turned out in Washington and New York on Saturday for Earth Day events that organizers have framed a celebration of science to counter a growing disregard for evidence-based knowledge.\n\nMarch for Science, which includes teach-ins on the National Mall and parades in midtown Manhattan and hundreds of other cities and towns, is billed as non-partisan, aimed at reaffirming the vital role science plays in our democracy, according to the marchs website.\n\nEven so, the marches were effectively protests against steep cuts that President Donald Trump has proposed for federal science and research budgets and his administrations skepticism about climate change and the need to slow global warming.\n\nIts important to show this administration that we care about facts, said Chris Taylor, 24, who was part of an early crowd of about 2,000 who gathered on the Mall for teach-ins on topics like climate change, water quality and sustainable food.\n\nIt just seems like theyre not really concerned about economic growth or creating new technologies, just catering to massive corporations, said Taylor, who is earning a PhD in robotics at George Mason University in Virginia.\n\nMarch for Science is the latest in a series of national demonstrations that have been staged since Trumps inauguration nearly 100 days ago. Previous marches and protests have focused on a range of partisan issues, from abortion rights to immigration policy.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment on Saturdays marches. However, in the past, Trump has said climate change was a hoax that was stifling policies to foster economic growth.\n\nHis administration is considering withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, a global accord aimed at reducing global emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Last year the United States, under President Barack Obama, joined more than 190 other countries in signing the pact.\n\nTrumps proposed 2018 budget calls for deep spending cuts by government science agencies, including a 31 percent reduction for the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nMarch organizers are also worried by what they see as growing skepticism from politicians and others on topics such as vaccinations, genetically modified organisms and evolution.\n\nThe direct involvement by the scientific community in a national policy debate has stirred some criticism about whether scientists should get involved in politics. But organizers have defended the march as crucial because of the threat posed by discrediting scientific consensus and restricting research.\n\nAs scientists, as human beings, our mandate is clear  its to stand up for what we know to be true, said Kellan Baker, a senior fellow at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and one of the speakers on the National Mall.\n\nThat theme was echoed by many of those who showed up in Washington for teach-ins, which organizers said were a centerpiece of the initial Earth Day held in 1970 to call attention to the environment.\n\nScience isnt respected and it needs to be, said Sarah Binkow, 22, a civil engineer who traveled from Pontiac, Michigan, to attend the Washington rally.\n\nBeing here definitely gives me hope that theres this overwhelming population that supports science and supports scientific theory, she said.",

      "text": "President Trump has removed chief White House strategist Stephen Bannon from his role on the National Security Council (NSC), a senior White House official said Wednesday.\n\nNational Security Adviser H.R. McMaster made the decision, which Trump approved, the official said.\n\nBannon, who led Trumps campaign in its final months, was elevated in January to a position on the NSC principals committee in a shakeup that drew widespread criticism that Trump was trying to politicize the council.\n\nThe chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and director of national intelligence had their roles downgraded in the move.\n\nThe Joint Chiefs chairman and intelligence director are having their roles as regular attendees of the principals committee restored, according to a regulatory filing dated Tuesday. The director of the Central Intelligence Agency will also have a permanent role on the committee.\n\nHomeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert also had his role on the council downgraded, but National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster can delegate his authority to call meetings and set the agenda to Bossert, according to the filing.\n\n\"Susan Rice operationalized the NSC during the last administration. I was put on to ensure that it was de-operationalized,\" Bannon said in a statement to The Wall Street Journal. \"General McMaster has returned the NSC to its proper function.\n\nThe moves are a sign that McMaster is looking to put his own stamp on the National Security Council and rework some of the changes enacted by his ousted predecessor, Michael Flynn.\n\nTrump administration officials said they wanted to shrink the size the council from its size under Rice, who was former President Obamas national security adviser, and pare down its role.\n\nBannon was placed on the council in order to ensure that Flynn actually did this, the White House official said.\n\nThe chief strategist did not need his role on the council now that McMaster is overseeing the changes, the official added.\n\nFlynn was fired in February after it was revealed he misled senior officials about his conversations with Russias ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak.\n\nUnder the new structure, Bannon could still be invited to attend NSC meetings, but will not necessarily be invited to each one.\n\nThe White House stressed the move is not a demotion for Bannon, who is one of Trumps closest advisers. The official said Bannon only attended one meeting of the principals committee.\n\nThe move was cheered by former Obama National Security Council official Ned Price.\n\nThe removal of Steve Bannon is as overdue as the addition of leading military and intelligence advisors, whose information and counsel have long been critical to the formulation of U.S. foreign policy, said Price, a former NSC spokesperson.\n\nJonathan Easley contributed to this report, which was updated at 12:42 p.m.",

Sessions asked. It makes no sense.\n\nThe attorney general also said that the administration would go after gang members in the country illegally, adding that they would be deported after they were arrested and served their time.\n\nIf they commit a crime, the law says they shall be deported, not may be, he said. We need to restore lawfulness.\n\nWe need to tell the people, Dont come illegally, if you want to come wait your turn, and when people start doing that well see a great improvement. And if somebody commits a crime, while theyre here legally or illegally, before permanent residence, then they can and should be deported, he added.\n\nSessions also pointed out that President Donald Trumps tough stance on illegals has already reaped benefits, noting that March had the lowest number of illegal aliens attempting to enter the country in 17 years.\n\nThis border is not open. If you come to America, come lawfully, Sessions said.\n\nTRENDING: Trump Takes Second Swing at Pakistan, Shows $250 Million Cut Was Only the Beginning\n\nRELATED: Schumer Wishes This Video of Him Being Honest About Illegals Never Existed\n\nShare this story on Facebook and Twitter if you agree with Sessions plan to crack down on sanctuary cities.\n\nWhat do you think of Sessions' warning?

      "text": "A video from 1990 showed that then-businessman Donald Trump knew years ago that CNN was not the bastion of journalistic excellence it claims itself to be.\n\nIn the video, CNN reporter Charles Feldman interviewed Trump about the opening of his Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City. Feldman mentioned securities analyst Marvin Roffman and other financial analysts who predicted the casino would not survive.\n\nTrump, put off by the mention of negative comments about the casinos future, mentioned inaccurate reporting by the media, which included CNN. When Feldman asked Trump for an example, the president said that the demeanor of reporters, as well as their questions, was inaccurate  or, like we call it today, fake.\n\nWhen Feldman asked Trump to explain, the president said the questions were put in such a way that they seemed like statements, which, in his estimation, was not good reporting. When Feldman asked for examples, Trump declined, saying he didnt didnt think his viewers would be very interested.\n\nTrump added that he didnt want to embarrass Feldman but it seemed that he already had.\n\nTRENDING: Trump Takes Second Swing at Pakistan, Shows $250 Million Cut Was Only the Beginning\n\nThe interview went on a little bit longer before Feldman returned to more negative remarks people had made about the casino.\n\nAnd that was Trumps breaking point. He said hed had enough, removed his mic and told Feldman he was negative and unfair. He stood up, shook Feldmans hand and walked out of the room.\n\nIt wouldnt be surprising if CNN has harbored a grudge against Trump all these years and tried to damage his reputation ever since. Ironically, its CNNs reputation that has gone downhill as more viewers become aware of the networks liberal agenda.\n\nIts worth noting that the Trump we see in this video doesnt appear to be much different than the Trump we see now, which is something that cannot be said about many  if any  politicians.\n\nShare this story on Facebook and Twitter to spread the word about how Trump has known for a long time that CNN reporters were difficult to deal with.\n\nRELATED: Seth Meyers Opens Show With Anti-Trump Joke, Fails Miserably in Room Full of Liberals\n\nWhat do you think of Trump calling out CNN 20 years ago?

      "title": "Jurisdictional issues tie up cyber efforts on Capitol Hill", 
      "text": "Congressional committees continue to lock horns over who has jurisdiction over cybersecurity, a recurring problem and frustration for lawmakers trying to deal in this policy space.\n\nCongress is in the middle of a two-week recess, but during the last legislative session, the House Science Committee passed a bill directing the National Institute of Standards and Technology to audit other agencies' cyber practices.\n\nThe bill was opposed by all but one Science panel Democrat, but its real problem is the intense opposition it has drawn from the House Oversight and Government Reform and other committees, according to congressional and industry sources.\n\nOversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, sent a scathing letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., in March detailing how the science panel's bill steps on the OGR panel's jurisdiction over government computer security and the Office of Management and Budget's established role in overseeing federal agencies' cyber efforts.\n\n\"The Oversight Committee has sole jurisdiction over the formulation and oversight of government-wide information security policy, including cybersecurity,\" Chaffetz wrote.\n\nIndustry groups also weighed in, saying the proposal would drastically revamp NIST's role and perhaps undermine its status as a trusted partner, and threatening to roll out their lobbying guns to fight the bill if it advances.\n\nScience Committee staffers defended their bill in a recent appearance before a NIST advisory panel.\n\n\"Despite ongoing efforts at [the Department of Homeland Security], there are still problems\" with securing the government's systems, said Cliff Shannon, House Science Committee staff director. \"If DHS were doing credible audits, we would not be having this conversation.\"\n\nSources say the House GOP leadership has signaled it has no interest in taking up the proposal, especially since it divides committee chairmen.\n\nAnother pending House measure is encountering obstacles related to jurisdiction that appear unresolved from the last session of Congress.\n\nHouse Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, has said he will soon introduce a bill to consolidate cybersecurity functions at the DHS in a new cyber agency. He tried to move a similar measure last year  all the way through the lame-duck session  but couldn't escape the jurisdictional obstacle course.\n\nSince then, a memorandum of understanding signed in January by the leaders of eight House committees with jurisdiction over the department was intended to clear the way for a first-time reauthorization of DHS this year. DHS, created in 2002, has never gone through a reauthorization intended to assess its mission and organization. The Department of Defense, by contrast, goes through the exercise every year.\n\nBut McCaul also believes the MOU should allow his separate bill reorganizing the department's National Protection and Programs Directorate into a cybersecurity agency to advance. Such a reorganization would help cement DHS's role as the lead civilian agency on cybersecurity, a long-held McCaul objective.\n\nHowever, some sources say McCaul's cyber-agency bill actually runs afoul of the MOU, because two other committees also claim jurisdiction over the Department of Homeland Security's NPPD.\n\nA Homeland Security Committee aide in an email response downplayed such concerns and said progress is being made on both the DHS reauthorization and McCaul's cyber restructuring bill.\n\n\"Working closely with leadership, Chairman McCaul signed an MOU with all the other committee chairmen with jurisdiction to ensure the House comprehensively reforms and improves DHS for the first time since its creation after 9/11,\" the committee aide told Inside Cybersecurity.\n\n\"Committees have been working on DHS elements within their jurisdiction and in a collaborative manner on elements with shared jurisdiction,\" the aide said. \"These efforts are being done in coordination with DHS.\"\n\nThe aide concluded: \"Right now we're in the process of working with the Trump administration in a bipartisan manner on the NPPD re-org bill. We expect to introduce a standalone bill soon and will announce a committee markup in the near future. We look forward to continuing the progress we made last Congress by working with other committees as the process continues.\"\n\nOne source with long Capitol Hill experience suggested that McCaul should set aside his cyber-agency bill and instead focus on reauthorizing DHS.\n\nUnder the reauthorization process agreed to in the MOU, which was brokered by Speaker Ryan, each of the eight panels would be responsible for writing pieces related to their areas of jurisdiction, and McCaul's committee would pull it together.\n\nThe Capitol Hill veteran, speaking on background, suggested that McCaul's NPPD reorganization could be folded into this process, which would also help ensure the Homeland Security Committee's place atop the jurisdictional pyramid.\n\n\"Put a working group together of the different committees and do the big reauthorization,\" the source said. \"That would be an olive branch to the other committees instead of a middle finger.\"\n\nThis is McCaul's final term as homeland panel chairman and the elusive goal of reauthorizing DHS  with the NPPD reorganization included in that package  could be the crowning achievement of his tenure.\n\nThe source predicted, \"The Homeland Security Committee will win the jurisdictional question if they pursue reauthorization and are the one that pulls the committees together.\"\n\nJurisdictional disputes have hamstrung cyber policymaking since the issue first gained visibility in Congress almost a decade ago.\n\nSometimes the competition among committees has derailed proposals that really weren't ready for prime-time. And sometimes those tensions have prevented Congress from getting its work done on urgent cyber priorities.\n\nHow these dynamics play out this year remains to be seen.\n\nCharlie Mitchell is editor of InsideCybersecurity.com, an exclusive service covering cybersecurity policy from Inside Washington Publishers, and author of \"Hacked: The Inside Story of America's Struggle to Secure Cyberspace,\" published by Rowman and Littlefield.",

      "text": "Mick Mulvaney, President Trump's budget chief, said Thursday that a Republican plan to repeal and replace Obamacare should pass the \"Jimmy Kimmel test,\" though his definition deviated from that of the comedian's.\n\nThe phrase \"Jimmy Kimmel test\" was coined by Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., after Kimmel delivered a monologue last week in which he shared difficult circumstances about his son's birth and pleaded for politicians to keep Obamacare's guarantee for coverage of people with pre-existing illnesses. Cassidy said he would vote for a healthcare bill only if it met that test, and Mulvaney was asked by a member of the audience at the Light Forum at Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., if he agreed with that standard.\n\n\"I do think it should meet that test,\" Mulvaney said. \"We have plenty of money to deal with that. We have plenty of money to provide that safety net so that if you get cancer you don't end up broke ... that is not the question. The question is, who is responsible for your ordinary healthcare? You or somebody else?\"\n\n\"That doesn't mean we should take care of the person who sits at home, eats poorly and gets diabetes. Is that the same thing as Jimmy Kimmel's kid? I don't think that it is.\"\n\nKimmel told Cassidy this week that his definition of the test was \"that no family should be denied medical care, emergency or otherwise, because they can't afford it.\"\n\nOf Kimmel's definition, Cassidy said: \"Hey, man, you're on the right track, if that's the closest we can get that works great in government. Now we have to be able to pay for it. That's the challenge.\"",

      "title": "Olympic Swimmer Adolph Kiefer Dies At 98", 
      "text": "Adolph Kiefer, the 100-meter backstroke champion at the 1936 Berlin Games, died Friday at the age of 98. He was America's oldest living Olympic champion.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Olympic Committee, Kiefer broke 23 records in all, including every backstroke record. But his grandson Robin Kiefer says, the swimmer considered his greatest achievement to be his work with the U.S. Navy during World War II. It was a time when many sailors were drowning after shipwrecks, and Kiefer helped develop a curriculum for teaching sailors to swim, as well as the \"victory backstroke,\" which is credited with saving thousands of lives.\n\n\"When he woke up in the morning, he was a swimmer, and when he went to bed he was a swimmer, and he dreamed about swimming and saving lives,\" Robin Kiefer said.\n\nThere was some doubt though, as to whether Adolph Kiefer and the other athletes would go to the Berlin Olympics at all. In a 2014 interview with his alma mater, the University of Texas, Kiefer explained that both the United States and England were considering a boycott of the German Olympics  \"the Nazi Olympics.\" In the end though, the U.S. team did go, and Kiefer met Hitler and shook his hand. He told the University of Texas in 2014, if he had known then what he knows now, \"I would have thrown him in the pool. But how do you know?\"\n\nThere were no Olympic Games held in 1940 or 1944 because of the second World War, so what might have been a longer Olympic career changed course. Kiefer went to college, and then joined the Navy, where he rose to the rank of Lieutenant. He married his wife Joyce, who would be his business partner and his partner in life for more than 73 years, until her death in 2015. His grandson says, the couple opened their backyard swimming pool in Northfield, Il, so that the neighborhood kids could learn to swim.\n\nTogether, Adolph and Joyce Kiefer built Kiefer Swim, a swimming equipment company that he is said to have joked sold \"everything but the water.\" They developed the nylon swimsuit, and the first non-turbulent racing lane, which helped to level the playing field by making it harder for swimmers to \"ride the wake\" of a swimmer in another lane.\n\n\"He didn't look back. He was always looking to the next new thing,\" said Bruce Wigo, the president of the International Swimming Hall of Fame. Wigo says that later in life, Kiefer was focused on helping elderly people use the water for exercise.\n\nEven after he was confined to a wheelchair due to neuropathy, Kiefer continued to swim everyday. Wigo said that Kiefer told him in the water, he felt \"human\" again. In 2014, at the age of 95, he was featured by the Chicago Tribune in an article and accompanying video. He told the camera, \"The feeling of swimming, of being independent, the feeling of relaxing in the water, is the greatest feeling in the world. Everybody should experience it.\"",

We remain dedicated to the passionate work of our volunteers and staff to empower and educate girls in their communities.\"\n\nThe agency did not immediately respond to a Daily News request for comment.\n\nAfter the program's launch in 2015, Michelle Obama traveled in Washington and abroad to help promote its cause.\n\n\"Education is a very personal thing for me,\" she said in October at the Newseum.\n\nJacquelyn Corley: What letting girls learn is really about\n\nThe Peace Corps and the U.S. Agency for International Development primarily ran the Let Girls Learn program.\n\nThe announcement came the same day Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue met with elementary school students in Leesburg, Va., to promote nutrition standards for healthy school lunches.\n\nThe ending of the program also comes as First Lady Melania Trump tries to develop her own platform in the White House. She previously said womens empowerment, education and cyber-bulling were important issues for her.\n\nI continue to firmly believe that education is the most powerful way to promote and ensure women's rights, Trump said during a speech at an International Womens Day luncheon in March.\n\nTogether we will do this not only by striving for gender parity at all levels of education, but also by showing all children, and especially boys, that it is through empathy, respect and kindness that we achieve our collective potential,\" the First Lady added.",

      "text": "While most Americans are not confident in President Donald Trump's ability to deal with the North Korean crisis, both the administration's rhetoric and the responses of North Korea and its allies are causing things to heat up in the region.\n\nDuring an unannounced visit to the Demilitarized Zone  a 2.5-mile-wide stretch of land filled with landmines that stretches across the border of North and South Korea  Vice President Mike Pence declared that, in light of North Korea's continued attempts at testing a nuclear missile, \"the era of strategic patience is over.\"\n\nPer pool at DMZ, Pence just said: \"the era of strategic patience is over.\" Which means what, exactly?\n\nPence's comment was most likely a reference to the policy of bilaterial U.S.-North Korean relations articulated by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during President Barack Obama's administration. At that time, Clinton famously declared that the administration would handle North Korea with \"strategic patience in close consultations with our six party allies.\"\n\nSimilarly, national security adviser H. R. McMaster told ABC's \"This Week\" that \"the consensus with the president, our key allies in the regions  Japan and South Korea in particular, but also the Chinese leadership  is that this problem is coming to a head. Its time for us to undertake all actions we can, short of a military option, to try to resolve this peacefully.\"\n\nIn what is most likely a response to America's new policy toward North Korea, China and Russia have sent out intelligence-gathering vessels to trail the USS Carl Vinson, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier that America dispatched to the waters outside the Korean Peninsula. It is currently believed to be in the vicinity of the East China Sea.",

      "text": "JON SCOTT (HOST): Breaking news. We have just learned of two major bombshells in the Russia investigation. The first one involves President Trump's conversation with Russia's foreign minister and U.S. ambassador during their visit to the White House this month. The two Russians spoke with President Trump in the Oval Office the day after he fired FBI Director James Comey. The New York Times reports the president told Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.S. Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, \"I just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut job.\" And, \"I faced great pressure because of Russia. That's taken off.\" The White House says Comey's investigation did create unnecessary pressure on U.S.-Russian relations. The White House is also not denying a report from The Washington Post that investigators in the Russia case have identified a current senior White House official as a significant person of interest. Kevin Corke, live at the White House with more. Kevin?\n\nKEVIN CORKE: Jon, very interesting. I had a conversation with a White House official not long ago, and it was interesting the way she put it. She said, \"Don't you find it interesting that the Times and the Post released these stories after the president took off for his trip overseas?\" Making the insinuation that this is a coordinated attack on this White House, the likes of which we have seen for quite some time.\n\nThey are however not denying, or at least on the record, denying the substance of either report, but they are releasing statements. Let me just share part of what [White House press secretary] Sean Spicer had to say in particular about that Washington Post story, the suggestion that the Russia probe is now involving current White House officials at the highest level of government. Spicer saying in this, and I quote, \"As the president has stated before, a thorough investigation will confirm that there was no collusion between the campaign and any foreign entity.\" I have said that all day long based on my conversations with White House officials, and they continue to say as much as well.\n\nThe New York Times story, on the other hand, is an interesting one because it effectively, if you listen to the White House, violates the law because we're talking about a conversation that has now been disclosed to the public. Let me share again part of what Sean Spicer had to say about The New York Times reporting of that conversation that you just laid out in the Oval Office. And again I'm quoting now, \"The president has always emphasized the importance of making deals with Russia as it relates to Syria, Ukraine, defeating ISIS, and other key issues for the benefit and safety of the American people. By grandstanding and politicizing the investigation into Russia's actions, James Comey created unnecessary pressure on our ability to engage and negotiate with Russia.\" He goes on to add, \"The investigation would have always continued, and obviously the termination of Comey would not have ended it.\" Lastly he adds, \"Once again, the real story is that our national security has been undermined by the leaking of private and highly classified conversations.\" Those, of course, the words of Sean Spicer. Then the tough part for the White House, as you well point out, this is all going to hit the fan when they get down there on the ground.",

      "title": "A Forgotten Piece Of African-American History On The Great Plains", 
      "text": "A Forgotten Piece Of African-American History On The Great Plains\n\nBlink while driving on Highway 34, east of Greeley, Colo., and you might miss the former town of Dearfield.\n\nAll that's left of the once-thriving town on Colorado's eastern plains are a rundown gas station, a partially collapsed lunch counter and a former lodge. They are the only indication that there was once a community here. The grass around these buildings is crispy and straw-colored, whipped back and forth by relentless winds. The snowcapped Rocky Mountains barely peek through the haze to the west.\n\nAbandoned towns from the early 20th century are far from unique on this stretch of the Great Plains. Withered storefronts and collapsed homes are common. Boom and bust economics and harsh weather made it tough for turn of the century settlers to succeed long-term.\n\nFew ghost towns, however, have all the elements that make Dearfield's story so compelling: larger than life characters, struggles to live off the land, tales of racial integration at the height of the Jim Crow era.\n\nNearly a hundred years have passed since Dearfield's streets were bustling with homesteaders, the people who made this town special.\n\n\"It was the most successful, best known, African-American farming community in the United States at the time,\" says George Junne, professor of Africana Studies at the University of Northern Colorado, and the resident expert on Dearfield.\n\nStarting in 1910, Dearfield began attracting hundreds of black homesteaders from across the South, the Midwest and the eastern portion of the Plains. They came for opportunity. At its height in the early 1920s, 700 residents lived in town, with churches, a school, a blacksmith shop, a dance hall and a restaurant. And nearly all of the residents were black.\n\nThe community sustained itself on farming, taking advantage of the relatively abundant rains at the time. They had bumper crops  strawberries, squash, wheat  for more than a decade.\n\nUnlike many Colorado towns, Dearfield did not come to be during the large wave of westward expansion spurred by the passage of the Homestead Act of 1862, but rather, a later iteration called the Enlarged Homestead Act. It enlarged the amount of land a homesteader could access and encouraged movement into more marginal lands, like where Dearfield was located.\n\n\"It pulled together primarily African-Americans who were interested in owning their own homes and their own farms,\" Junne says.\n\nThe Man Behind The Town\n\nThe community was the vision of its creator: Oliver T. Jackson, a successful black entrepreneur from Ohio. He started restaurants, ran the catering operation at Boulder's Chautauqua Dining Hall, and acted as a messenger for a series of Colorado governors.\n\nJackson wanted a place where black people could take out loans, work the land and get ahead. And he saw promise in the patch of land that eventually became Dearfield.\n\n\"He had a vision,\" Jay Trask, head of the University of Northern Colorado's archives, which houses found letters from Jackson and other Dearfield ephemera. \"He had a really exciting vision. And I think it was a vision shared by a lot of African-American folks in Denver. There was a desire to create an African-American community, an agricultural community that would be their own.\"\n\nJackson was Dearfield's biggest cheerleader. He championed its early successes in farm magazines and newspapers that served African-American readers, and to local and regional politicians.\n\n\"He was not shy about getting his name out there,\" says Trask.\n\nWhile Jackson spent his time marketing the community and working in Denver, his wife, Minerva, acted as the town's \"judge, jury and executioner,\" according to Junne. She ran the town's day-to-day operations, and ran them tightly. \"When she snapped her fingers, you jumped,\" Junne says.\n\nIn promotional pamphlets, Jackson touted the community's rich soil and view of the mountains. Always on the lookout for newcomers to town, he made clear they were looking to grow. He never stopped thinking up new ways to make Dearfield succeed and fill its coffers, Junne says. Even Prohibition offered Jackson an opportunity.\n\n\"For a while, this town was known as 'Beerfield' because he was bootlegging here,\" Junne says. \"He needed to make money to keep things going. The people all around here knew about it and they gave the nickname.\"\n\nDearfield gained a foothold during an incredibly tense time in America.\n\nAlong with other predominantly black towns like Nicodemus, Kan., and Boley, Okla., Dearfield sprang up at the height of the Jim Crow era. An active Ku Klux Klan chapter started in Denver around the same time, which was eventually infiltrated by Dr. Joseph H.P. Westbrook, a Denver resident and early Dearfield booster.\n\nYet, Coloradans and other homesteaders on the plains did not see new black residents to the state as a threat, either culturally or economically, Junne says. Despite rampant racism and violence in parts of the country, Junne says Dearfield's residents mostly found harmony with their neighbors.\n\n\"People had to work together. You had to work together, even if you didn't like the person,\" Junne says. \"So I think this whole thing about the solitary Westerner is a bit overdone because you had to rely on your neighbors.\"\n\nNewspaper articles in nearby Greeley marveled at the work ethic of the new residents. Many black farmers would pick up extra work on the white-owned farms surrounding the town, Junne says. A black Dearfield farmer was one of the first in the region to purchase a newly redesigned mechanical reaper and would lend it out to white farmers in the area. The plains communities, white and black, developed an interdependence on each other.\n\nElsewhere in the country, post-Reconstruction African-Americans were marginalized and disenfranchised in a myriad ways. Their votes suppressed or never counted. Schools were off-limits to black students. Violence against black communities was commonplace. And that's part of why Dearfield gained its rosy reputation. Just the fact that it existed and was largely successful, became a bright spot for black Americans.\n\nWhile the town was certainly an agricultural experiment in testing out dryland farming techniques on Colorado's plains, it quickly became a social experiment, too. Early signs of integration were on display at the town's dance hall.\n\nDearfield was home to Squire Brockman, a well-known black musician. He would set up shop on Saturday nights to play fiddle and mandolin.\n\n\"The white people in the area would come out here and they would dance,\" Junne says. At the time, black people and white people were not dancing as couples, \"but they were on the same dance floor together.\"\n\n\"So, again, you started to have the roots of integration because people respected each other,\" Junne says. \"They needed each other.\"\n\nFor about 20 years, the town was a success. Then came the one-two punch of the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl.\n\nIn the early 1930s, the large thunderhead clouds that were so common before, stopped materializing. Dearfield's seasonal creeks dried up. So did its wells. The residents had not acquired water rights to properly irrigate fields; instead, they relied on natural rainfall. Without rain, they could not grow their crops.\n\nBy 1940, Dearfield was largely deserted. Its founder, O.T. Jackson stayed until his death in 1948. Many people moved to Denver's Five Points neighborhood in search of work, or moved even further west. Just a few residents hung on. The last known full-time resident of Dearfield was Jackson's niece, Jenny Jackson, who lived on-site until she died in 1973.\n\nToday, a plaque sits outside the dilapidated lunch counter that tells the history of Dearfield. The town site's ownership is a patchwork: some owned by a real estate developer, other plots owned by descendants of the original homesteaders, and parcels owned by Denver's Black American West Museum.\n\nGrant money over the years has allowed historians and anthropologists to restore and protect the few buildings still standing, but Junne says it is in serious danger of disappearing. There is little money available to keep Dearfield's structures from further succumbing to the harsh weather. In 1999, the town was listed as one of Colorado's \"Most Endangered Places.\"\n\n\"It was a wonderful idea, a wonderful experiment, and the spinoffs are just as important,\" he says.\n\nTake for example, one of Colorado's first integrated schools just down the road from Dearfield, and the dozens of other black farm communities on the plains that tried to replicate the town's success. Denver's Five Points neighborhood owes some of its history to the early homesteaders at Dearfield.\n\nThat's the legacy of Dearfield, Junne says. It thrived for years during a period that was fraught with racial tension. And its residents were able to build a community from scratch at a time when it seemed impossible.\n\nLuke Runyon reports for Harvest Public Media and is based at member station KUNC in Greeley, Colo.",

      "title": "Washington threatens funding cut to California, other 'sanctuary' areas", 
      "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters)  The U.S. Department of Justice threatened to cut some funding to California as well as eight cities and counties across the United States, escalating a Trump administration crackdown on so-called sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with federal immigration authorities.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has vowed to strip federal funds from dozens of state and local governments that do not fully cooperate with U.S. immigration agents, arguing they endanger public safety when they decline to hand over for deportation illegal immigrants who are arrested for crimes.\n\nSanctuary cities in general offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants and often do not use municipal funds or resources to advance the enforcement of federal immigration laws.\n\nMany of these localities say they do not have the funding or space to hold immigrants until federal agents can take custody of them.\n\nThose threatened were: the state of California; New York City; Chicago; Philadelphia; Clark County, Nevada; New Orleans; Miami-Dade County, Florida; and Milwaukee County, Wisconsin. Cook County, Illinois, also received a warning, even though it did not get money from the Justice Department last year.\n\nThe jurisdictions have until June 30 to provide evidence to the federal government that they are not violating any laws.\n\nAt stake is roughly $29 million in law enforcement aid under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, which helps local governments pay for everything from forensics labs to drug courts.\n\nThe grants in question are among the largest handed out under the program, collectively amounting to 11 percent of the $256 million distributed in the last fiscal year.\n\nIn a statement, the Justice Department singled out Chicago and New York as two cities that are crumbling under the weight of illegal immigration and violent crime, even though New York City is experiencing its lowest crime levels in decades and experts say Chicagos recent spike in violent crime has little to do with illegal immigration.\n\nSeveral state and local officials responded with defiance to the threat.\n\nNew York is the safest big city in the country, with crime at record lows in large part because we have policies in place to encourage cooperation between NYPD and immigrant communities, said Seth Stein, a spokesman for New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.\n\nIn California, the state Senate approved a bill earlier this month to curb cooperation between police agencies and federal agents seeking to deport illegal immigrants. The measure is now in the state Assembly.\n\nIt has become abundantly clear that Attorney General (Jeff) Sessions and the Trump administration are basing their law enforcement policies on principles of white supremacy  not American values, California Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin de Leon, a Democrat, said in a statement on Friday.\n\nA spokeswoman for the California Board of State and Community Corrections said some of the federal funding in question went to local communities after emergencies, including San Bernardino after a mass shooting there in 2015.\n\nOfficials in Philadelphia, Milwaukee County and Cook County said they believed they were complying with immigration laws.\n\nMilwaukee County has its challenges but they are not caused by illegal immigration. My far greater concern is the proactive dissemination of misinformation, fear, and intolerance, said Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele.\n\nThe Fraternal Order of Police, the largest police union, told Trump in a meeting last month that they were concerned the cuts could threaten public safety.",

      "title": "One Lesson of Trump's Reversals: It's All About Access", 
      "text": "In a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal, President Trump made a remarkable admission. He was describing his conversations with President Xi Jinping of China, whose nation he had insisted could solve the North Korean nuclear standoff easily if only it set its minds to it. Xi argued otherwise, Trump recalled: He then went into the history of China and Korea. Not North Korea, Korea. And you know, youre talking about thousands of years ... and many wars. And Korea actually used to be a part of China. And after listening for 10 minutes I realized that notits not so easy. You know I felt pretty strongly that they havethat they had a tremendous power over China. I actually do think they do have an economic power, and they have certainly a border power to an extent, but they alsoa lot of goods come in. But its not what you would think. The anecdote is telling for a couple reasons. Many people have said Trump is ignorant on policy issues, but in this case Trump himself fessed up to having had no real understanding of the history of the Korean peninsula. In fact, he knew so little that in just 10 minutes, his own view of the conflict was turned around. The message this sends to foreign leaders is that Trump is not well-versed in the issues about which he confidently pontificates, but that he can quickly be persuaded to come around to their viewhardly the strength Trump promised he would bring to the White House. The Chinese government seems to have grasped that Trump was a blank slate, pushing for a face-to-face meeting between the two men early in Trumps term so that Xi could help set the agenda and terms for their relationship. Trumps tendency to take up the position of the last person with whom he spoke on a given issue has been widely noted. Xis claim that North Korea is an intractable problem is a widely held one, and North Korea bedeviled Presidents Obama, Bush, and Clinton, too, but its disconcerting that a foreign leader could so quickly dazzle Trump. The combination of little knowledge and practically no ideological commitments also makes the ongoing battle between factions in Trumps White House much higher stakes than they might otherwise be.\n\nTrumps about-face on China and North Korea is just one of several headspinning reversals over the last week. As I wrote today, many of those changes in position seem to reflect a simple transition: Before, Trump didnt know the facts of what he was talking about; now he does. He insisted time and again, over the course of nearly two years, that China was nefariously devaluing its currency, but now he realizes that since 2014 Beijing has actually been spending heavily to prop it up. He used to think the U.S. should avoid engagement in Syria; now that hes seen evidence of chemical-weapons use and barrel bombs, both of which Bashar al-Assad was already using when Trump was against intervention, he has changed his mind. He used to think Russia could help solve the Syrian problem; now he understands that Vladimir Putin is one of Assads two most important patrons. These reversals are notable because, despite common skepticism of campaign promises, politicians usually try to do most of what they said once they enter office. Even in a mass-media era where the winner of most presidential elections is the candidate with the most winning personality, presidents continue to view their mandate as based in their policy prioritiespartly because it might be discouraging to think otherwise, and partly because their core supporters demand it. Take Barack Obama, who expended massive political capital early in his term on passing a huge overhaul of the health-insurance system. As a matter of policy and justice, this may have been wise, but as a matter of politics, it stank: Even as public opinion turned sharply against reform, the White House kept its foot on the gas. The blowback helped doom Democratic control of the House of Representatives, and the resulting law was consistently unpopularuntil, that is, Trump tried to repeal it.\n\nVast learning is neither sufficient nor necessary to be a successful president. Some of the commanders-in-chief with the most impressive academic resumes turned out to be mediocre or even bad presidents. Besides, all presidents face some sort of learning curve. Bill Clintons plans to allow gays to serve openly in the military quickly crashed on the shoals of political reality. George W. Bushs denunciations of nationbuilding as candidate gave way to two huge nationbuilding efforts after September 11. Obama signed an executive order ordering the closing of the prison at Guantanamo Bay on his first day but never actually followed through. Nonetheless, the scope of Trumps recent reversals, and his frank admission of not knowing the facts, sticks out. Trump has not reversed all of his major promises, of course. He still continues to promise to build a wall on the Mexican border, though its increasingly apparent that wont be the 50-foot-high concrete colossus hed promised. Other priorities, like renegotiating NAFTA, have been quietly shifted over to the back burner. The president seems to recognize that in voting for him, supporters were voting for Trump the manor perhaps more accurately, Trump the brandrather than for his policy platform, which was spotty, flimsy, and sometimes contradictory. Indeed, when confronted with his ignorance during the campaign, he bragged that he could easily learn everything he needed to know in just a few days.\n\nBut reckoning with his policy ignorance could be liberating for Trump. Freed from any imperative to actually follow through on some of his more ideological but less widely popular promises, Trump might pursue policies that were both more popular and more productive. This is a dynamic already seen on Obamacare repeal, and after all, when voters praised Trump as a dealmaker, werent they really saying they wanted a pragmatist rather than an ideologue? The rest was just rhetoric. But this also carries clear risks. When you dont know things, you are more likely to make errors. This is even more dangerous when, as Donald Rumsfeld could have taught Trump, you dont know what you dont know. Youre easily susceptible to the influence of others, too. I have argued that the Clinton White House, which struggled through a chaotic start, offers a useful analog for the Trump administration. But the interpersonal feuds within the Clinton administration were largely about jockeying for individual position and proximity to the president. The conflict between various Trump aidesnotably, strategist Steve Bannon, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, and senior adviser Jared Kushnercould matter much more, because the stakes are not simply their own advancement and the ability to nudge the president slightly in one direction or another. Bannon, who is reportedly on the outs at the moment, offers a starkly different worldview, including his espousal of white nationalism and fondness for Putin, than does Kushner, who seems to resemble a corporate Democrat in many ways, or Priebus, a mainstream Republican. With a president this untutored on the issues, todays West Wing intrigue threatens to be tomorrows major U.S. policy shift.",

      "text": "There are a lot of things about politics and politicians that make me want to drop a brick on somebody's toe  scratch that, make it a cinderblock  and I am very bipartisan in these less than noble feelings.\n\nThere is a situation going on in Washington right now that perfectly exhibits the nature of my anger, and if I hear one more Democrat, pay attention Chuck Schumer, say that Republicans don't want poor people to have health care or some other bit of otherworldly hyperbolic crap, I'm apt to throw said brick or cinderblock at a television screen.\n\nIn the first place, and I speak as one whose overall opinion of both political parties is a couple of cuts below my opinion of carpenter bees, even I would never accuse any congressperson of not wanting poor people to have health coverage.\n\nBut I do want to flip this coin over, and hyperbole totally excluded, I'm beginning to think that Mr. Schumer and his ilk would rather that the whole nation go without health care if the plan is created and instigated by the opposition party.\n\nIn case you haven't noticed, Obamacare is disintegrating right before our eyes, and if something stable and sane is not put into place soon the whole program is going to do what it was designed to do and totally implode.\n\nIn the first place, Mr. Schumer, if your party hadn't put this monstrosity together and threatened, courted and bribed members of Congress to pass it, we wouldn't have this two-ton albatross around our collective necks to begin with.\n\nI know, I know, sir, Hillary was supposed to be president, and I'm sure that the one payer system she would have introduced to save the day when Obamacare finally went belly up is in a locked desk drawer somewhere on Capitol Hill gathering dust. I also know that this pill must be hard to swallow, but it ain't gonna happen, at least for the next four years.\n\nSo why don't you and your disgruntled colleagues do what the rest of the people in this nation have to do, and learn to work together. If you're a truck driver and don't like the guy who runs the fork lift that loads your trailer, you can't refuse to haul the load. You cant stick your petulant thumb in your mouth, take your ball and go home.\n\nThe rest of us working stiffs dont have that privilege, Mr.Schumer. We have to hook up the trailer and take it to the destination, and sir, you shouldn't have that privilege either.\n\nRefusing to try to help win the game just because somebody else made the touchdowns is the attitude of a spoiled junior high, jock wannabe.\n\nHow bout you folks on both sides of the aisle cowboy up and start moving in the same direction for a while, instead of putting your accursed party first.

      "text": "Somalia's security forces have shot dead a 31-year-old government minister after mistaking him for a militant Islamist, officials have said.\n\nHe was killed in his vehicle near the presidential palace in the capital, Mogadishu, the officials added.\n\nThe president has cut short his visit to Ethiopia following Abas Abdullahi Sheikh's killing, state radio reports.\n\nHe grew up in a refugee camp, and became Somalia's youngest MP in November and a minister in February.\n\nSomalia has been wracked by conflict since the long-serving ruler Siad Barre was ousted in 1991.\n\nIt is currently battling militant Islamists from the al-Shabab group, which is affiliated to al-Qaeda.\n\nSecurity forces on patrol came across a vehicle blocking the road and, thinking it was being driven by militants, opened fire, police Major Nur Hussein told Reuters news agency.\n\nMr Abas was killed \"by mistake - they opened fire on his car accidentally. May God rest his soul\", Mogadishu mayoral spokesman Abdifatah Omar Halane was quoted as saying.\n\nSomali youth have been robbed of a role model following the shocking death of Mr Abas. Always polite and well-dressed, the former child refugee was widely admired for his determination to succeed.\n\nComing from a prominent religious family, Mr Abas studied at Kenya's prestigious Nairobi University and entered politics last year.\n\nHe became an MP for the port city of Kismayo in Somalia's Jubbaland region after an electoral college chose him ahead of a government minister who had been on the political scene for more than two decades.\n\nMr Abas' victory showed that Somalis were fed up with the old guard, and were demanding change. Sensing his popularity with the youth, the president appointed him to the cabinet in March.\n\nLess than three months later, this rising star has become the latest casualty of more than two decades of violence in Somalia. But in this case some are asking: Has Somalia lost a future president?\n\nMr Abas was given a state funeral in Mogadishu attended by President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed Farmajo, members of parliament, Somali youth and elders.\n\nPresident Farmajo has ordered security chiefs to \"immediately get to the bottom of this unfortunate tragedy\" and make sure the perpetrators were \"brought to book\".\n\nInformation Minister Abdirahman Osman said several people had been arrested, but did not give details, state-owned Radio Mogadishu reported.\n\nTroops are sometimes nervous, and have previously shot officials - and each other - by mistake, says BBC Somalia analyst Abdullahi Abdi.\n\nBut Mr Abas, the public works minister, is probably the most high-ranking official killed by \"friendly fire\", he adds.\n\nMr Abas grew up in Dadaab camp in Kenya, home to hundreds of thousands of Somalis who fled drought and conflict.\n\nThe president appointed Mr Abas to the cabinet following his surprise election victory in February.\n\nPresident Farmajo promised to improve security and establish an effective government in Somalia.\n\nMuch of the country is still under the control of al-Shabab.",

      "title": "Did Google just surpass Monsanto as the world's most EVIL corporation?", 
      "text": "(Natural News) For a very long time, Monsanto has been known as the worlds most evil corporation for promoting poison, monopolizing the seed supply and suing farmers after contaminating their fields with GMOs. But now, Google seems to have supplanted Monsanto, taking the prize as the worlds most evil corporation for its outrageous censorship, collusion with spy agencies and blatant attempts to propagandize the world with dishonest, deceitful information about everything from politics to natural medicine.\n\nGoogle, which was once founded on the slogan of Do no evil has in many ways become the very thing it once opposed. Beyond mere evil, Google seems to have recently become the most dangerous entity on the planet, threatening human freedom, human knowledge and the very future of human society as youll read below.\n\nWhat do you think about Google now? Sound off in the comments section below...\n\nMere weeks after de-listing the entire Natural News website due to a totally fabricated technical excuse, Google has now been caught red-handed instructing its contractors to rate content as low or medium quality for independent media website InfoWars, which exposes globalist agendas. InfoWars, which remained silent about Googles censorship of Natural News, has now learned that remaining silent is a horrible idea because, well, Then they came for me.\n\nNow InfoWars is in the crosshairs of Google, which seems determined to manually alter its search results to deliberately silence all views Google doesnt like. The dishonest search engine even chooses clickbait websites like BuzzFeed and Salon to fact check search engine results around sensitive topics such as Hillary Clinton, whom the delusional Left still insists never had a fainting spell and didnt help sell U.S. uranium mining rights to Russian-owned mining companies.\n\nLost in all this is the fact that the independent media is the only truly free press remaining in America, while the corporate-run establishment media is steeped in blatantly fake news and an all-out abandonment of anything resembling real journalism. If you want to see a real journalist doing real journalism, look no further than Luke Rudkowski of WeAreChange.org. All by himself, the guy has more courage and gumshoe journo-sense than the entire staff of the New York Times.\n\nIn fact, it is the independent media that has led the way on every groundbreaking story that was once called a conspiracy theory, including Susan Rices surveillance of Trump team officials, the NSA spying on all your phone calls, Smart TVs spying on citizens and even the scientific evidence that vaccines cause autism in African-American infants. While the corporate-run media tries to cover up all these truths, the independent media is breaking the stories wide open on a daily basis, effectively taking over the job from the old school media and proving that citizen journalism is the future for truth on the internet. The rising new media, in other words, is making the old media look incredibly incompetent, which is why Google is now desperately trying to silence the new media and protect the old media monopolies from their impending collapse.\n\nIn conjunction with those types of attacks, we have also the mainstream establishment media attack Independent Media, from labeling them fake news to calling them Russian propaganda, as well as actively sitting on stories that reflected badly on the previous administration, such as the Susan Rice unmasking bombshell, which was revealed by Independent Media personality, Mike Cernovich, who also reported that MSM outlets had the news, specifying Bloomberg and the NYT, but were refusing to report the truth to their audience. That was proven true when Bloomberg published their article over 14 hours later, confirming that Cernovichs blockbuster, exclusive report was true.\n\nNo wonder Google is trying so desperately to destroy and censor the independent media: WERE WINNING at every level! Thats because humanity wants to be free, and it is only through censorship, oppression and Google-style Ministry of Truth destruction of human knowledge that humanity can be kept enslaved. Over 70,000 people signed our Whitehouse petition to stop Google censorship, and that was during the time that Google 100% censored every Natural News web page, by the way, in a malicious effort to silence us.\n\nIn a financial assault aimed at the independent media, Google is deceptively down-rating independent media web pages in a sneaky, covert effort to destroy web traffic to those sites. Its also aggressively demonetizing independent media YouTube channels, ripping away as much as 90% of the revenue earned by indy media content producers.\n\nThis is, of course, a form of economic sabotage against the independent media, deliberately waged by Google against the most important new voices of our generation. Googles attempts to silence indy media voices is just as damning and destructive as historical efforts to silence people like Martin Luther King, Jr. who fought for human freedom and awakening (and was killed for doing so, of course). Would Google have stood up for MLK Jr., vs. the establishment status quo? Not a chance.\n\nJust as damning is Googles all-in protectionist schemes to protect the profits of Big Pharma by tweaking search algorithms to favor pro-drug results while suppressing natural remedies and holistic medicine (which represent the only real solution to our current health care crisis, by the way). Did you know that Google Adwords blocked the Health Ranger Store from remarketing advertising because we sell superfoods and herbal remedies? We were told that because we offer medicinal mushrooms, we are selling what they claim is medicine (that obviously might threaten the profits of Big Pharma). Not that we want to hand money over to Google anyway, but it sure is informative to know that weve been banned for the simple reason that we offer safe, affordable, scientifically validated natural remedies that help save lives. Apparently, saving lives with natural medicine is despised by Google.\n\nOn every topic you can think of  natural medicine, independent media, GMOs, economic freedom, medical choice, pesticides, the abortion industry, infectious disease, etc.  Google has now aligned itself with the most evil, destructive and criminal forces across our world. Its now apparent to an ever-increasing number of people that Google has become the enabler of mass human death, destruction and suffering while censoring freedom, truth and awakening.\n\nWhat do you think about all this? Do you agree that Google is steeped in evil? Sound off in the comments below and let your voice be heard (while you still have a voice, anyway...).\n\nBeyond promoting discredited mainstream news sources (CNN, NYT, etc.) that seek the absolute destruction of liberty, health and objective truth, Google has also gone all-in for spying on its own users, suppressing human knowledge and enriching the most evil corporations on the planet (such as Monsanto, Merck, Syngenta, Nestle, etc.)\n\nStarting with banning independent media from Google News to now openly encouraging penalties against indy media news sites, Google seems determined to enslave humanity in a delusional bubble of false information from official sources that only know how to LIE. Those sources, of course, all tend to be Leftist, liberal sources that have now repeatedly shown they are completely intolerant of all opposing views, labeling them hate speech even if they are reasoned, rational analysis or opinions. In effect, Google has become an extension of the intolerance of its employees and executives, and it is wielding its search engine results as a weapon against human knowledge to usher in a new era of left-leaning totalitarianism that pretends to be truth.\n\nIf you add it all up, it sure looks like Google wants to enslave humanity, destroy independent thought, silence the voices of reason and dominate humanitys future. And it is very close to achieving all those sinister goals right now.\n\nThe upshot of all this is that if you use Google in any way  Google search, Google analytics, Google adwords, etc.  you are supporting what might just be the most evil corporate entity on the planet. Its also true if you own Google shares, by the way, because just owning such shares provides financial capital to the corporate entity that originally sold those shares.\n\nIf youre not an evil person, you need to think twice about using Google or owning Google shares. Upon closer inspection, you may find that Googles actions violate your own human ethics and contradict the very things you believe are important for keeping humanity informed, aware and as free as possible. You already know that human freedom is not possible unless humans are free to think for themselves, right? And they arent free to think if theyre not free to access dissenting views that question the status quo. It is precisely those dissenting views that Google is now aggressively silencing.\n\nAs a result, each of us who cares about the future of freedom and real progress for the human race must make a concerted effort to boycott all Google services and products to the greatest extent possible. Sadly, Google has attained a monopoly position of dominance over search, although smaller, independent search services do exist such as GoodGopher.com, which I created to index the independent media. DuckDuckGo.com is another Google search alternative that currently seems to provide excellent results, and it doesnt spy on you like Google does. To see indy media news headlines throughout the day from censored websites, visit and bookmark Censored.news.\n\nAs Mike Cernovich said yesterday in an interview on InfoWars, he believes its time to organize a mass PEACEFUL protest of Google and its employees. The independent media may indeed be reaching a point where its very survival depends on organizing an effort to physically occupy Google campus sites, protest Googles outrageous censorship policies and demand an end to Googles totalitarian oppression of human knowledge.\n\nPerhaps its time that Google employees were told to their faces that they are working for the worlds most EVIL entity which is suppressing and enslaving humanity. The day is probably not far off when Google employees will be publicly shamed and condemned for taking part in the systematic pattern of economic sabotage, censorship and deliberate monopoly protectionism of poison-pushing corporate entities that Google protects. The Left is morally and fiscally bankrupt, devoid of coherent solutions, and corrupted by its embrace of the Corporatocracy, writes Charles Hugh Smith in a must-read blog article entitled The Lefts Descent to Fascism. His definition of fascism includes this gem that applies perfectly to Google:\n\nThis status quo (i.e. The Establishment) seeks to impose a conformity of values and opinion that support the dominant narratives of the status quo via the mass (corporate) media and the state-controlled educational system... Dissent is by definition fake news or hate speech  Orwell would be so proud of the Lefts deft doublespeak.\n\n\n\nYou cant be pro-Google and anti-corporation at the same time, by the way. If you oppose corporate monopolies and the 1% running the world, then you must by definition strongly oppose Google for the simple reason that Google protects the 1% and silences the 99%.\n\nI think the day is coming when people who work for Google will be condemned for being part of a dangerous, ominous algorithm that seeks the total enslavement of humanity. Today, people who work for Monsanto dont run around bragging about their employer, because they know Monsanto has a well-earned reputation for being a deeply evil corporate entity. That same situation is probably coming soon for Google employees who may one day soon look in the mirror and see themselves with a great sense of shame for taking part in the evil domination pursued by Google.\n\nIf we dont stop Google, its only a matter of time before Googles robot division attains sufficient physical capabilities and A.I. prowess to be unleashed as Terminator-style Hunter-Killer robots to target human beings on the battlefield (or perhaps to even target political enemies). Its not as far off as you might suppose. Before you know it, Google will be building massive armies of corporate-run robot soldiers, and Google will become a military might unto itself. What will Google do with all that power?\n\nAs Google itself has already demonstrated, it will wield power to silence its enemies, suppress the truth, enslave humanity and dominate everything in sight. Its not difficult to see how, given another 25 years of such evil run amok, Google could overthrow entire nations and supplant the governments we know today with its own totalitarian corporate dictatorship. To envision how Google might operate in a future where it controls the most dangerous humanoid robots armed with weapons, just ask yourself how Google operates today. Does Google respect humanity or does it try to enslave it? Does Google tolerate competition and criticism, or does it try to silence those who speak out against it? Does Google protect the privacy of its users, or does it sell you out with back door access to the NSA that violates your Fourth Amendment privacy every second of every day?\n\nThe answer is abundantly clear: Google has become the worlds most evil  and dangerous  corporation. It has become a danger to human freedom, human knowledge and even human life. If we dont stop Googles march toward totalitarian dominance, the future of our world will look like a destitute dystopian society of enslaved humans, all kept ignorant and uninformed about reality (thanks to Googles suppression of truth).\n\nNo criticism of the accepted, fact-checked reality will be allowed on YouTube, Google or much of the internet, as any person who dares contradict the Leftist totalitarian narratives will be immediately stripped of ad revenues, search engine visibility and public credibility.\n\nGoogle  which should probably be renamed OBEY  will have achieved its ultimate goal of silencing all dissent, controlling all knowledge and overthrowing any governments that oppose it. In this future, Google will run all elections, and all winners of such elections will be little more than Googles puppets, rubber stamping their legislative schemes that continue to grant more power to everything Google.\n\nAnd one day, half the human population will be declared obsolete and no longer needed by the globalists because Googles advanced robots will replace human labor. At that point, the depopulation ovens will run 24/7, all powered by Googles A.I. algorithms, of course, which will calculate the most efficient expenditure of energy to terminate a human life.\n\nThis is the future for humanity if Google is not stopped.\n\nShare your views on all this in the comment section below. And be sure to bookmark this website, because Google will no doubt fabricate another reason to ban it in order to prevent awakened citizens from reading this thoughtful article that seeks to protect human freedom from internet tyrants.",

      "title": "Schumer to Sessions on NYC safety: Ride the Subway with me at 4 a.m.", 
      "text": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D - New York, ribbed Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Monday, encouraging him to ride the New York City subway at 4 a.m. in an effort to debunk the Department of Justices claims about crime in the Big Apple.\n\nDuring an interview on MSNBCs Morning Joe, the senior senator from New York denounced a statement released last Friday by the Department of Justice, which lambasted New York, among other counties and cities, for its sanctuary city policy, gang violence and soft on crime law enforcement.\n\nMy daughters, you know, theyre young adults, but they ride the subway at 4 a.m., and Im perfectly happy about it, Schumer said. We are a safe city.\n\nBy the way, New York has grown from 7 million people in 1990 to 8.5 million today, the largest of any city, because crime went down, Schumer added. Mothers from Denver and Dallas were not sending their daughters and sons to New York in 1990. Now theyre happy to do it.\n\nSchumer later said he would be happy to ride the subway at 4 a.m. with Jeff Sessions.\n\nOn Sunday, Sessions eventually distanced himself from attacking New York City law enforcement after Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York Police Commissioner James ONeill rebuked the statement.\n\nThat statement was focused on the sanctuary city policy, but look, for four decades, New York has been a fabulous city for law enforcement, Sessions said on ABCs This Week. Theyve developed some of the best techniques ever. Theyre so far ahead of many other cities. I think we should all study the tactics that have been developed.\n\nSessions continued: Rudy Giuliani and others over the decades have really transformed New York. Theyve proven community-based policing, broken-windows policing can make cities safer, save lives, and other cities need to be studying what theyve done.\n\nIn March, Schumer called on Sessions to resign after The Washington Post reported that he had failed to disclose to the Senate that he had met with Russian envoy Sergey Kislyak during the 2016 presidential election.",

      "text": "Disgruntled Trump supporter, perhaps we could say ex-Trump supporter, Milo Yiannopoulos has posted a picture that is paradoxically cryptic and blatant.\n\nJust in case anyone was wondering whether it was a one-off, hes posted it as his Facebook cover photo, for all to see at all times.\n\nPerhaps, the photo is simply a sign of solidarity between to former Breitbart stars who have lost their jobs lately. Milo voluntarily quit Breitbart whilst Bannon was demoted from his role on the National Security Council.\n\nHowever, with Steve Bannon saying nothing publicly since the infamous demotion which came a day before Donald Trumps illegal attack on Syria, Breitbart and indeed former Breitbart writers like Milo, may be an window into what Brannon is thinking.\n\nBreitbart did after all recently run a front-page story on Michael Savages disillusionment with Trumps newly formed hawkish foreign policies.\n\nIs Bannon considering running for President in 2020? Does Milo know something that the rest of the world does not?\n\nOr is it simply a showing of solidarity combined with a publicity stunt?",

      "title": "Schiff: Trump trying to shift attention from Russia probe", 
      "text": "WASHINGTON  The top Democrat on the House intelligence committee said Sunday that President Trump's claims about illegal wiretapping and news leaks are an attempt to distract people from the overall investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russians who sought to influence last year's election.\n\n\"I would tell people, whenever they see the president use the word 'fake,' it ought to set off alarm bells,\" said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Cal., speaking on CNN's State of the Union.\n\nWhile Schiff said \"I don't think we can say anything definitively at this point\" about the probes of Trump and Russia, the president denounced the entire set of investigations and continued to stress claims that President Barack Obama and his administration had him wiretapped last year.\n\n\"The real story turns out to be SURVEILLANCE and LEAKING! Find the leakers.\" Trump tweeted Sunday.\n\nThe FBI and the House and Senate intelligence committees are investigating claims of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russians who hacked Democratic Party officials close to nominee Hillary Clinton  a sprawling set of probes that now involve the recent actions of other officials.\n\nRep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., the chairman of the House intelligence committee, is under fire for visiting the White House on his own to review information about the wiretapping claims and then briefing Trump himself about it.\n\nSchiff told CNN he reviewed the same information at the White House on Friday, While not commenting on what he saw, Schiff said the information should be released publicly.\n\nIn the meanwhile, former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn  fired for not disclosing the contexts of talks he had with Russia's ambassador to the United States  is seeking immunity from prosecution in order to testify before Congress.\n\nWhile Trump backed Flynn's request, Schiff told CNN that it's too early to say whether the FBI or congressional committees should grant immunity,\n\nNumerous law enforcement officials have said that neither Obama nor his aides authorized a wiretap of Trump Tower during last year's election, as the current president alleged in a March 4 series of tweets.\n\nIn recent days, Trump has cited a Fox News report an intelligence official in the Obama administration \"unmasked\" the names of people associated with the Trump team in intelligence reports.\n\nThe president has also denounced the Russia investigation in general, tweeting Saturday: \"It is the same Fake News Media that said there is 'no path to victory for Trump' that is now pushing the phony Russia story. A total scam!\"\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., speaking on ABC's This Week, said the rising number of claims and counter-claims is the big reason a special congressional committee is needed to investigate what he called a Russian attack on the foundations of American democracy.\n\n\"Every time we turn around, another shoe drops from this centipede, and we need to examine all of the aspects of it,\" McCain told ABC's This Week.",

      "text": "Despite the fact that Donald Trump is barely over the 100-day mark of his first  and, hopefully, only  term as president, hes already reportedly profiting from his re-election bid.\n\nFor those keeping track, the 2020 election campaign is still three years away.\n\nAccording to The Huffington Post, though, Trumps office building has received $274,000 in rent over the first three months of this year for an election more than three years away.\n\nMore from the report:\n\nPresident Donald Trumps re-election campaign has sent $274,000 in rent to Trumps office building during the first three months of this year, even though fewer than two dozen employees are on the payroll for an election more than three years away. That total works out to a monthly average of $91,000, which is more than half of what Trumps campaign was paying Trump Tower each month at the height of the presidential race last year.\n\nIts absurdly early to be putting so much money toward expenses related to his re-election campaign, especially when his presidency has been such an epic dumpster fire so far. Its also another example of how Trump is using his position as president  and a presidential candidate  to profit.\n\nThis isnt new, though.\n\nLast year, The Huffington Post reported that Trump jacked up Trump Towers rent last year when he ditched his commitment to self-fund his campaign, though that was always a joke to begin with.\n\nTrump nearly quintupled the monthly rent his presidential campaign pays for its headquarters at Trump Tower to $169,758 in July, when he was raising funds from donors, compared with March, when he was self-funding his campaign, the report noted.\n\nAs president, Trump is doing his best to follow the same blueprint. In his tax plan released last week, the president would stand to gain tens millions of dollars each year.\n\nWhile Trump has been a failure by nearly every measure during his first three months in office, he has mastered the art of using his position to turn a personal profit  all while screwing the lower- and middle-income voters who helped elect him last year.\n\nWith 2020 three years away, it appears there is never a time too soon for Trump to start profiting off a presidential campaign.",

      "text": "A White House Spokesman said yesterday that President Donald Trump would gladly face Oprah Winfrey as an opponent in the 2020 presidential race.\n\nAs most of you probably already know by now the 63-year-old Oprah Winfrey is being lauded for stealing the show at the Golden Globe awards on Sunday night with her speech after being awarded the Cecil B. DeMille award for achievement and lit up social media with a surge of tweets carrying #Oprahforpresident and #Oprah2020. Yes, our fellow Americans are that insane.\n\nThe nine-minute speech generated two standing ovations from the Hollywood elitists and went on to prompt 220,000 posts on social media mentioning the words Oprah and president in only 24 hours according to the internet social media analytics company Talkwalker.\n\nAccording to political analysts, after Trump beat out what is considered to be the most qualified presidential primary field in history and went on to win the White House in 2016 with help from his popularity and fame as a reality TV star, it no longer seems out of the norm to consider a similar campaign by Winfrey who is an actress, movie and television producer, and chief executive of her OWN cable channel.\n\nOprah got a standing ovation from the Hollywood crowd at the January 6, 2018 Golden Globe awards when she said:\n\nFor too long, women have not been heard or believed if they dared to speak their truth to the power of those men, but their time is up. ... Their time is up. So I want all the girls watching here and now to know that a new day is on the horizon! And when that new day finally dawns, it will be because of a lot of magnificent women, many of whom are right here in this room tonight, and some pretty phenomenal men fighting hard to make sure that they become the leaders who take us to the time when nobody ever has to say, Me too.\n\nIf Oprah and her Hollywood pals dressed in expensive black gowns had given this speech in 1997 when Bill Clinton, darling of the Hollywood left, was abusing Monica Lewinsky, groping Kathleen Willey, harassing Paula Jones by dropping his pants, and credibly accused of rape by Juanita Broaddrick, then Oprah and Hollywood would have some credibility. Oprah and her Hollywood pals did not support the victims of Bill Clinton, nor say they should have been believed. Clintons victims were vilified and insulted by the Clinton thugs, such as James Carville, as trailer trash, as if a certain social class of women can be sexually abused by Clinton with no recourse and no support from the Oprah crowd.\n\nOprah did not mention Bill Clinton and his enabler, Hillary, whom Oprah endorsed in 2016. Oprah did not explain why she would endorse Hillary, who attacked the women victimized by Bubba. What happened to believing Monica Lewinsky, Paula Jones, Juanita Broaddrick, and Kathleen Willey, who dared speak truth to power?\n\nNor did Oprah mention Ted Kennedy leaving Mary Jo Kopechne to die in his car at the lake in Chappaquiddick, or her pals such as Spacey, Weinstein, Dustin Hoffman, Charlie Rose, etc. Instead, Oprah stuck to the Hollywood company line to complain in general terms. These hypocrites all knew about the Hollywood culture of abuse exemplified by Democrat darlings and fundraisers, such as Weinstein and Spacey, but never said a word for years, except to refer to Weinstein as a god (in the case of Meryl Streep).\n\nOprah did speak about Recy Taylor, a black victim of a rape in 1944 by white men. Oprah apparently does not care about the rape of Juanita Broaddrick by her pal, Bill Clinton, but Oprah knows her audience and base, so she talked about a 1944 rape of a black woman. She knows how to play the race card like Barack Obama, her Chicago pal.\n\nOprahs speech has aroused CNN and the rest of the Fake News Media to start cheerleading for an Oprah 2020 presidential run. Time magazine is already predicting how Oprah can beat Trump.\n\nOprah must be looking at the current crop of Democratic candidates, such as Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren, Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Kamala Harris and concluding that she can beat this bunch. She will have the Hollywood money.\n\nShe now has to criticize Bill Clinton to polish up her resume of standing for women. It is twenty years too late to criticize Bubba, but that does not matter to her cheerleaders in the Fake News-Destroy Trump Media.\n\nFake New media giant CNN cited two of her close friends who have spoken on condition of anonymity. At least one of them emphasized that Winfrey had made no firm decision but was seriously considering the run. Just one speech, thats how the Barack Hussein Obama nightmare started.\n\nI can already see many on the right laughing over this. But we shouldnt. This woman has all the qualifications those in America who suffer from white guilt are looking for. Nevermind her politics, she is an African-American woman who is a so-called #metoo victim herself, although her claim has been brought into question many times before.\n\nPlease share if you agree Oprah needs to stay away from politics...\n\nFOLLOW us on Facebook at Freedom Daily!",

      "text": "Price's Remarks On Opioid Treatment Were Unscientific And Damaging, Experts Say\n\nAddiction experts are up in arms over remarks by Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price in which he referred to medication-assisted treatment for addiction as \"substituting one opioid for another.\"\n\nNearly 700 researchers and practitioners sent a letter Monday communicating their criticisms to Price and urging him to \"set the record straight.\"\n\nThe medicines Price referred to are methadone and buprenorphine, both of which are opioids. The letter notes that there is a \"substantial body of research\" showing the drugs' effectiveness and that they have been the standard of care for addiction treatment for years.\n\nThe drugs tamp down cravings and prevent withdrawals, helping people suffering from addiction to stop misusing prescription or illicit opioids and to get back to living productive lives. Experts say Price's remarks, made last week to the Charleston Gazette-Mail, ignore the primary benefits of such medications and go against scientific evidence.\n\n\"I was just totally gobsmacked,\" says Brendan Saloner, an addiction researcher and assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nSaloner says that Price's own Department of Health and Human Services displays information online that contradicts his comments. The HHS website includes a link to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's information page about medication-assisted treatment, which explains:\n\n\"I couldn't believe we were having to reopen this conversation. It totally flies in the face of all the evidence,\" Saloner says. \"These drugs are highly effective in restoring a sense of normalcy in people's lives.\"\n\nPrice instead touted treatment with a third addiction medicine, Vivitrol, a brand name formulation of naltrexone, which is an opioid blocker. All three drugs  methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone  have been shown to help reduce relapse and keep people in treatment.\n\n\"Instead of talking about getting the right medication to the right patient at the right time, [Price] actually maligned the use of buprenorphine and methadone,\" says Dr. Corey Waller, an addiction psychiatrist who heads legislative advocacy at the American Society of Addiction Medicine.\n\nAddiction experts say that Price's remarks are consistent with widespread but inaccurate views on the use of buprenorphine and methadone, also known as opioid maintenance therapy. They worry that the secretary's comments perpetuate those views. \"It's not replacing one drug for another, because we define addiction based on behavior, not on the absence or presence of a drug,\" says Waller.\n\nAn HHS spokesperson, Alleigh Marre, wrote in an email that Price's remarks did not signal a shift in the department's policies regarding the drugs. \"One of the five pillars of the secretary's strategy to combat the opioid epidemic is expanding access to treatment and recovery services, including medication-assisted treatment,\" she wrote.\n\nThis story was produced by Side Effects Public Media, a news collaborative covering public health.",

What Trumps latest scheme indicates is that he doesnt have the Republican votes needed to pay for the wall, so he is holding your health care hostage unless you pay for the wall.\n\nDemocrats arent going to stand by and let their constituents health care be held for ransom.\n\nThe answer to Mulvaneys proposal will be a loud and resounding no. If Trump wants to pay for the wall, he can either pay for it himself or have his bigoted supporters who want the wall cover the cost.\n\nTrump claims to be a builder, so let him build his own damn wall, and leave our health care out of it.",

      "title": "No US president should bow or scrape", 
      "text": "When, during a presidential debate in 2007, Barack Obama said he would agree to meet the world's worst dictators \"without precondition,\" he was rightly chastised for it.\n\nHis error was not in believing that negotiation and diplomacy have a role to play, or that it is sometimes necessary for America's president to grip the hand of an odious head of state to improve relations and make the world a better place.\n\nIt was, rather, Obama's profligacy with the prestige of the office he sought and his naive overconfidence in the power of his personality and good intentions to persuade the world's worst rulers to reform. His suggestion that he meet with the tyrants of Tehran suggested he thought it acceptable to use the leverage and prestige of the presidency cavalierly rather than with care and proper preparation.\n\nLike Obama, President Trump is overconfident of his ability to persuade and cut a deal. In consequence, he seems not to think carefully before suggesting he will meet with the world's tyrants and rogue leaders, presumably taking the attitude that there is much to gain and nothing to lose.\n\nBut this is not true. There is much to lose. It is not for nothing that American presidents are traditionally referred to as the leader of the free world. What the free world is these days is not as clear as it was a generation ago, but it is still just as obvious who has the top job in it.\n\nMost foreign leaders crave an audience with the president. They rush to be the first to meet him after he is sworn in, so they can preen about being at the front of the line. If the president himself seems to deprecate the prestige of the office, offering meetings to dictatorial riff-raff without precondition, he cheapens one of his most valuable assets.\n\nTrump has been criticized for cozying up to foreign tyrants. He said it would be \"an honor\" to meet North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, \"a smart cookie\" who holds his benighted people in the world's most brutal and hermetically sealed prison state. Trump also extended a White House invitation to Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who has carried out extra-judicial killings of his own people.\n\nKim is the despotic ruler of a nuclear- and repressive government that detains as many as 200,000 of his own citizens in camps. Duterte rose to power by pledging to kill all the drug dealers and users in the country. After succeeding in killing thousands, international human rights organizations are weighing whether to label his exploits \"crimes against humanity.\"\n\nIt may be a good thing for Trump to meet Duterte, for the Philippines is crucial to America's diplomatic efforts to control North Korea. But this can be achieved without going immediately for the pomp and circumstance of a White House reception. And any meeting should be set up on the understanding that Trump will confront Duterte on his shabby human rights record.\n\nIt may even, at some point, become advisable to meet Kim Jong Un. Although that possibility seems exceedingly remote, one cannot dismiss it entirely because presidents have shaken hands with some of the world's greatest killers in order to secure the strategic needs of the U.S. and its allies. But it will never be an \"honor\" to meet the North Korean potentate, merely at most a loathsome necessity. Suggesting it would be an honor is an echo of Obama's excruciating bowing to foreign monarchs early in his presidency. The president shouldn't bow to anyone, and it's an honor for them to meet him, not the other way around.\n\nA meeting with the president is something earned, not given away casually. It confers legitimacy and prestige, and it offers a platform that grabs the world's attention for foreign leaders who cannot otherwise command it. It doesn't matter how great Trump's negotiating powers are, or how wonderful he believes them to be. They cannot hold a candle to the attention-grabbing brilliance of the office he occupies.",

      "text": "Democrats in the New York Senate and Assembly have introduced a bill to require the state of New York to release tax records for any president or vice president who files a return in the state.\n\nThe bill, which was introduced Monday, would give residents a five-year look-back of every candidates state tax returns, according to The Associated Press. It would also apply to top state positions such as governor, attorney general, and state lawmakers.\n\nLawmakers in more than a dozen states have drafted legislation that would require any presidential candidates in the future to release their federal tax returns in order to appear on the states ballot, but because President Donald Trump hails from New York, legislators there say they want to use the situation to their advantage.\n\nDemocratic state Sen. Brad Hoylman of Manhattan said the state is in a unique position to change the national conversation.\n\nThis is drawing a line in the sand. Are you for transparency or not? Hoylman asked. This is an issue of national security.\n\nDemocrats run the New York Assembly, where the measure is expected to pass, but lawmakers expect it to die in the Republican-led state Senate.\n\nTrumps tax returns have been the subject of intense public scrutiny since the 2016 presidential campaign, and the issue has come to a head as he plans to propose tax reform legislation. In an interview with CBS News that aired Sunday, Trump narrowly sidestepped the issue.\n\nRight now, Im under audit. After the audit is complete. Its a routine audit, but I have a very big tax return. Youve seen the pictures. My tax return is probably higher than that from the floor, Trump said.\n\nAside from Trump, every president serving since Jimmy Carter has released their tax returns.",

      "title": "Obama fingerprints at DNC?", 
      "text": "Former President Obamas White House political director is informally providing strategic advice to leaders at the Democratic National Committee (DNC).\n\nDavid Simas, who is now CEO of the Obama Foundation, is close with DNC Chairman Tom Perez and has been in regular contact with Sam Cornale, a top adviser to Perez.\n\n\n\n A source who has been involved in the transition said Simas has provided strategic advice on hiring decisions.\n\nThe new chairman has asked for resignation letters from most DNC staff as he begins the process of building his own team, although so far the DNC has only unveiled its communications team.\n\nThe talks with one of Obamas most prominent political aides underscore the delicate line walked by the DNC as it charts a way forward after a divisive presidential primary battle last year.\n\nAny conversations between Perez and political figures who are viewed as being part of the establishment can be greeted with suspicion by liberal Democrats, who want to see the DNC stocked with progressives after the organization tilted the scales in favor of Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonGrassley blasts Democrats over unwillingness to probe Clinton GOP lawmakers cite new allegations of political bias in FBI Top intel Dem: Trump Jr. refused to answer questions about Trump Tower discussions with father MORE and against Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernard (Bernie) SandersSchumer: Franken should resign Franken resignation could upend Minnesota races Avalanche of Democratic senators say Franken should resign MORE (I-Vt.) last year during the presidential campaign.\n\nPerez, Obamas Labor secretary, was seen as the former presidents favored candidate in the race for the chairmanship earlier this year. Progressives were disappointed when he defeated Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), who ran with the support of Sanders.\n\nA spokesperson for the DNC downplayed the conversations, saying Simas is not advising in any official capacity and that talks with Perez represent just a small part of the input the chairman is taking from Democrats across the country as he seeks a path forward for a party devastated by its loss of the White House in 2016.\n\nHundreds of people from across the country have given input, volunteered their time, or sat down with Tom and other DNC officers to help rebuild the party, DNC communications director Xochitl Hinojosa said in a statement.\n\nSome liberals also say theyre not concerned about the conversations  as long as the DNC changes its operation.\n\nTom Perez can talk to whoever he wants, said progressive activist Jonathan Tasini. The more critical measure is looking at whether he will clear the decks and purge the party of the whole class of consultants and self-promoters, from the sleazy David Brocks to the various people pocketing big bucks who shake down campaign committees and super PACs, all of whom have failed miserably over a decade if you look at the party's woeful state at every level.\n\nOthers argued that it makes sense that Perez, a former Obama administration official who has no formal electoral experience of his own, would seek advice from seasoned political hands.\n\n\n\n Theyd be smart to listen to folks who have experience with this sort of stuff, said a former DNC official.\n\nBut other liberals expressed concern that former Obama officials could have too much influence over the DNCs direction.\n\nHopefully its just Perez taking advice from as many sources as possible, but it also looks like the DNC did not learn any lessons from 2016 that the party needs to be rebuilt by grassroots liberals, not from the top down, one progressive told The Hill.\n\nPerez, Ellison and the DNC have gone to great lengths to signal the party is coming together after last years divisive primaries.\n\nPerez tapped Ellison, a progressive favorite and rival DNC chairman candidate, to be his deputy chairman. Perez and Ellison have already hit the road together for campaign-style events seeking to capitalize on liberal energy ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.\n\n\n\n Perez will venture out with Sanders later this month on a nine-state tour to push progressive policies that the former Democratic presidential candidate championed during his campaign. \n\n\n\n Liberal groups have been happy to see Perez attend their resistance events, as he did last month when MoveOn rallied outside the White House against President Trumps ban on immigrants coming from Muslim-majority countries.\n\n\n\n The Perez-Ellison team has been more real than I thought it would be, the former DNC official said. I think theyre serious about fully integrating the Democratic Party.\n\n\n\n There have been stumbles along the way.\n\n\n\n Last month, progressive groups aired their frustrations with the DNC after it announced a 30-member transition advisory committee, believing the roster needed more liberals. \n\n\n\n But some Democrats believe the left was well-represented on a committee that included labor activist Ai-jen Poo, Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), union activist Brian Weeks, Black Lives Matter figure DeRay McKesson, former American Federation of Teachers aide LaToia Jones, and former DNC chairman candidates Pete Buttigieg, Sally Boynton Brown and Jehmu Greene.\n\nThat has frustrated some mainstream Democrats, who believe no amount of concessions to the left will ever be enough.\n\n\n\n I think theres some groups where the advocacy is not a means to an end; its a means in perpetuity, one well-connected Democrat told The Hill. Theyre just contrarian, and nothing you can ever do will be enough.\n\nPerez has since met personally with representatives from Progressive Change Campaign Committee, as well as several other liberal groups, like MoveOn and the National Domestic Workers Alliance.\n\n\n\nThe lines of communication are open and weve had initial conversations with chairman Perez about what a win-win partnership with grassroots liberals might look like, as opposed to top-down outreach, said Kait Sweeney, the spokesperson for PCCC.\n\n\n\nHe is committed to rebuilding our state parties and we hope that process respects the millions of liberal activists taking action in the Trump era, she continued. Theyre engaged now and they dont wake up thinking about the DNC. These people have to be brought into the party and we hope the DNC will genuinely engage with progressives groups that have experience mobilizing millions because that would be a win for everybody.\n\n-- This story was updated at 11:31 a.m.",

      "text": "When now-President Donald Trump first burst on to the political scene, one of the ways he made a name for himself was by ridiculing many of the trade deals the United States has spent the last several decades cutting.\n\nTrump pointed out that our trade agreements were far from free.  They were usually one-sided sell-outs  where we agreed to not tax or regulate other countries imports, while none of the other countries agreed to do any such thing with ours.\n\nTrumps frequent visual aide was China (I still have yet to find a way to spell phonetically the way he pronounces it).  China taxes everything we send them.  China gives all sorts of preferential treatment to their companies that export.  China even manipulates their currency to artificially lower the prices of their exports on the global market.\n\nAbout all of which we do...nothing.  We continue to cut deal after deal with them.  Where we pledge all sorts of free market protections for their products  and they promise none for ours, and are allowed to continue to manipulate the market in all of the same ways they always have.  And then we wave around the next signed agreement and hail it as another free trade deal  when it is anything but.\n\nThe United States has for decades been the Neville Chamberlain of trade agreements.  In what weve been engaged isnt free trade  its appeasement trade.  Its unilateral capitulation to every other nation on the planet.\n\nWonder why our domestic production has spent the last half century fleeing our countrys confines?  Because nigh every other country on the planet treats it better than do we.  (Not just in trade deals  in tax and regulatory policy too.)\n\nTrump rightly called for an end to this titanic nonsense.  And all of the usual free trade suspects  who have spent the last several decades selling our domestic producers down the Yangtze, Ganges and Rio Grande Rivers  denounce him as protectionist.\n\nWhen the alleged free traders  are the only protectionists in the equation.  Protecting their cushy, overseas-manufactured, global-governments-protected profits  from an intrusion by Reality.  At the continued, further expense of American production.  (Think about all of this when next you hear opposition to policies like the Border Adjustment Tax [BAT].)\n\nTrump wants less government involvement in trade  on all sides of the equation.  Rather than the unilateral disarmament in which we have for so long engaged.  Reducing the market manipulations of all governments everywhere  is actual, real, freer and freer trade.\n\nThese moves toward less government  are born at the bargaining tables.  The United States is far and away the largest market in the world  and we have for far too long been negotiating as if we are Tuvalu or Montserrat (no offense intended to either of the two smallest economies on the planet).  We should be wielding our market weight  and cutting deals that reflect it.\n\nTrump prefers bilateral agreements to multilateral ones  and on this too he is correct.  The more nations involved in a trade deal  the less negotiating power any one nation has.  Every other nation loves to enmesh us in multi-player agreements  because we lose the inherent leverage we have.  Sit down one-to-one  and there is no Big Government safety in numbers.\n\nWe at Less Government immediately hailed the arrival of Trump and his actual free trade policies  because they are virtually identical to for what we had been calling for years prior.\n\nHere we are on May 17, 2013: What we should instead do now is zero-out our protectionist...regime(s)  in exchange for (other countries) simultaneously doing the same.  We can  and absolutely should  use all our considerable trade negotiation prowess to effect this regulations-and-subsidies clean slate.\n\nAnd here we are on October 10, 2013: The worlds...nations need to sit down together, each with a copy of everyone elses lists of protectionist...policies. And start horse trading.  Brazil  how about if you get rid of this subsidy, well each get rid of one.  Mexico  if you get rid of this tariff, well each get rid of one.  Let the subsequent discussions ensue. Lather, rinse, repeat.\n\nIt all sounds very Trump-like, does it not?  And now that Trump is President  it appears that things are beginning to take this turn for the oh-so-much better.\n\nChina Offers Concessions to Avert Trade War with U.S.: China will offer the Trump administration better market access for financial sector investments and U.S. beef exports to help avert a trade war...U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Friday that President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have agreed to a new 100-day plan for trade talks on Friday.\n\nGuatemala Agrees to Early Poultry Tariff Elimination: Office of the U.S. Trade Representative is set to announce today that Guatemala has agreed to eliminate its 12.5 percent tariff on U.S. fresh, frozen and chilled poultry products four-and-a-half years earlier than expected under the U.S.-Central American-Dominican Republic free trade agreement, approved by Congress in 2005....\n\nGet that?  We in 2005 cut a deal with teeny, tiny Guatemala.  That allowed them to keep in place a 12.5% tax on our chicken imports  for SIXTEEN YEARS.  How is that a free trade deal?  How is that using our leverage as leverage?  How pathetic and stupid is that?\n\nHeres hoping the Age of Trump augurs a new age in American trade.\n\nWhere we stop apologizing for being successful  and use the leverage our success gives us to ensure that there is less government in trade all over the world.\n\nWhere we work to ensure that other nations treat our stuff fairly and freely  the way we have for so long treated theirs.\n\nIt would be a wonderful new dawn indeed.",

      "text": "Big bucks from George Soros helped turn a Pennsylvania district attorney election on its head, in the latest example of the liberal billionaires influence in local U.S. politics.\n\nOn April 28, Soros poured nearly $1.5 million into the Philadelphia Justice and Public Safety PAC, which supported candidate Larry Krasner in the Democratic primary. Krasner won on Tuesday, and by a wide margin.\n\nHe is expected to win the general election this fall, as Philadelphia is a Democratic stronghold. How much of a difference the PAC money made is unclear, but the cash infusion helped pay for TV commercials, campaign literature, and online ads to promote the candidacy of the civil rights attorney who has never worked as a prosecutor.\n\nThe race marked the first time a super PAC has supported a D.A. candidate in Philadelphia.\n\nKrasner, as the Daily Caller puts it, benefited from the kind of capital typically reserved for important national political campaigns.\n\nBut its not the first time Soros has pumped cash into local D.A. races, in an apparent bid to shape the approach to law enforcement on the ground level.\n\nLast August, Politico reported that Soros had channeled more than $3 million into seven local district-attorney campaigns in six states over the past year.\n\nThe Washington Times looked at all of 2015 and 2016, reporting Soros sunk more than $7 million into at least 11 local prosecutor races in 10 states in that period. The report described it as part of an effort to implement criminal justice reform from the inside.\n\nOne race Soros supported in Texas already has led to a policy change. Kim Ogg, who won the election for district attorney of Harris County last fall, after a cash influx from Soros, announced she will decriminalize small amounts of marijuana in the Houston area.\n\nThat goes against President Trumps Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has taken a tough stance on marijuana and has said he is not in favor legalizing the drug.\n\nFox News reached out to Soros for comment regarding the latest election. The Philadelphia PACs treasurer Whitney Tymas replied to Fox News and cited Krasners platform as the reason for supporting him.\n\nPhiladelphia Justice & Public Safety supported Larry Krasner for district attorney because of his commitment to public safety and criminal justice reform, Tymas said.\n\nAfter his victory, Krasner spoke to reporters and said the Soros cash wouldnt affect his policies. I dont have to pick up the phone for anyone, Krasner told reporters. Its no disrespect to Mr. Soros, whom I have never met, or his organization, but the bottom line is I have held these views for a long time.\n\nBen Waxman, a spokesman for Krasners campaign, told Fox News, Larry Krasner has been a civil rights attorney in Philadelphia for over 30 years. He has handled many cases and has a deep amount of criminal justice experience. In addition, he is an activist. He has been doing and saying the same thing for 30 years.\n\nHe added, Other candidates spent a large amount of money in this campaign. The reason Krasner won is because of his ideas on criminal justice reform.\n\nWhen asked if Krasner appreciated the support offered by Soros and the Philadelphia Justice and Public Safety PAC, Waxman said the campaign had a strong coalition of voters.\n\nHe is thankful to all of his supporters, he said, this deep Philly-based coalition including his volunteers and his staff.",

Every story is badly slanted. We have to hold them to the truth! the president posted.\n\nIt appears that the president was spurred to hit the media by coverage of a recent House special election in Kansas, where Republican Rob Estes defeated Democrat James Thompson by 7 percentage points.\n\nTrump hit out at media hypocrisy, declaring that too much attention was given to it when it appeared it was close, but after Estes won, reports disappeared.\n\nThe recent Kansas election (Congress) was a really big media event, until the Republicans won. Now they play the same game with Georgia-BAD! Trump tweeted.\n\nReporters were surprised last week when Trump referred to some of them as very honorable people during a press event.\n\nTrump has repeatedly praised Fox News, particularly Fox and Friends, again tweeting Monday praising analysis on the show, and taking a dig at the Obama administration.\n\nTrump also retweeted a Drudge Report notification regarding a poll showing a rise in his approval ratings.\n\nThe President also recommended reading the book Reasons To Vote For Democrats: A Comprehensive Guide, which is mostly made up of blank pages.",

      "title": "Just 10 powerful globalist corporations control almost all the food you buy and consume", 
      "text": "(Natural News) When you go into a large supermarket, the number of food options you have to choose from is almost overwhelming. Just five feet from the main entrance, shoppers are immediately inundated with Oreos, Pringles, 2-liter bottles of soda, cases of water, candy, and various other snacks. Walking through the aisles, its common to see waffles, salsa, yogurt, coffee, juice, various kinds of cereal, and hundreds of other foods and drinks. Amazingly, there is one thing that nearly every single item inside of a typical grocery store has in common  they are all produced by just 10 international corporations.\n\nThe companies include Nestle, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, Unilever, Danone, General Mills, Associated British Foods, Kelloggs, Mars, and Mondelez, and each of them employs thousands of people and profits billions of dollars in annual revenue. Below is a breakdown of each of these global corporations and what it is that they produce:\n\nWith a 2016 revenue of $13 billion, Kelloggs is perhaps best known for cereal like Fruit Loops, Frosted Flakes, and Corn Pops. However, most people are unaware that Kelloggs also owns brands like Eggo, Pringles, Cheez-It, Pop-Tarts, Nutri-Grain, and Vanilla Wafers. In November of last year, Kelloggs announced that the company was pulling all of their ads from Breitbart.com due to the fact that the conservative website was not aligned with our values as a company. As a result, Breitbart launched a #DumpKelloggs petition and encouraged their readers to boycott.\n\nIn 2016, Associated British Foods collected a total revenue of $16.8 billion. The company owns several different brands, including Dorset Cereals, Twinings tea, Allied Mills, Westmill Foods, Speedbaker, and the retailer Primark.\n\nJust shy of Associated British Foods 2016 revenue, General Mills collected $16.6 billion last year. General Mills owns many popular cereal brands such as Cheerios, Chex, Kix, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Reeses Puffs, Trix, Cocoa Puffs, and Lucky Charms. Other non-cereal brands owned by General Mills include Yoplait, Hamburger Helper, and Betty Crocker.\n\nDanone is a corporation that is best known for yogurt. With a 2016 revenue of $23.7 billion, Danone owns Activia, Yocrunch, and Oikos, in addition to various nutrition products. Danone also owns some bottled water brands like Aqua and Evian.\n\nMondelez owns several popular snacking brands such as Oreo, Chips Ahoy, Sour Patch Kids, Cadbury, Trident Gum, Ritz, Triscuit, and Wheat Thins. Mondelez collected $25.9 billion in 2016.\n\nMars is a corporation that is best known for chocolate. With $35 billion collected in 2016, Mars owns Dove Chocolate, 3 Musketeers, Milky Way, Snickers, M&Ms, Twix and several other chocolate-based snacks. Additionally, Mars also owns Uncle Bens rice, Combos, Starburst, and Orbit gum.\n\nPerhaps one of the most popular corporations in existence in Coca-Cola, which owns dozens of different beverages from Spite to Fanta, Dasani to Minute Maid, Fresca to Mellow Yellow. Coca-Cola took in a whopping $41.9 billion in 2016.\n\nThough perhaps Unilever isnt the most well-known corporation in existence, it owns dozens of brands that most people use on a regular basis. With a 2016 revenue of $48.3 billion, Unilever owns Axe body spray, Lipton tea, Hellmanns mayonnaise, Dove, Degree deodorant, Vaseline and Ben & Jerrys.\n\nThe obvious brand owned by PepsiCo is the incredibly popular soft drink Pepsi. Other than soda, though, PepsiCo also owns Quaker Oatmeal, Gatorade, Cheetos, Tropicana, Tostitos, Lays potato chips, and Starbucks ready to drink beverages. PepsiCo collected $62.8 billion in 2016.\n\nIncredibly, the Nestle Corporation took in an astonishing $90.2 billion in 2016. In addition to popular candy brands such as Butterfinger and KitKat, Nestle also owns Gerber baby food, Perrier, Coffee-Mate, DiGiorno, Hot Pockets, Friskies and Purina.",

Clinton instructed a trusted aide to access the campaigns server and download the [email] messages sent and received by top staffers.\n\nThe purpose of the project was to expose staffers who Clinton believed were disloyal to her during the campaign, The Wall Street Journal writes in a review of Shattered, which relies on more than 100 sources.\n\nThe spy campaign shows that Clinton possesses an almost Nixonian paranoia about treachery and, second, that her use of a private email server at the State Department was never the naive mistake she pretended it was, The Journals review reads.\n\nBryan Pagliano, Clintons campaign IT director and the technician who managed her State Department server, was identified in one Sept. 3, 2015 email as retrieving emails from Clintons campaign system.\n\nPagliano was hired at the State Department in May 2009. Clinton paid him out of pocket to set up her server and to conduct maintenance on it when needed.\n\nPagliano would later talk only to the FBI about his work for Clinton. He did so only after receiving limited immunity.",

      "text": "A private school in Meerut city of Uttar Pradesh on Thursday allegedly issued a diktat to its students to sport Yogi-style haircut, raising the concerns of shocked parents who protested. But more worried are the retail counters of Patanjali products as the shampoo and oil sales have reached an all time low.\n\nRishabh Academy School in Sadar area had warned students they will not be allowed to attend school till they got the buzz haircut, akin to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanaths. Parents are worried that witha similar haircut, it will be difficult for them to distinguish between their children and their neighbors children. The Patanjali traders who were selling a lot of Shampoo and oil products will now face a slump in business and it is evident from the sales of past week as to how tough business will be in coming days.\n\nOur Faking News reporter  caught up with one such trader named Sanil Srivastava who had this to say,  People have a great trust in Patanjali products because of its authenticity and purity. But with such decisions how will we sell our products to the school going kids. Ramdev ji is trying to inculcate the culture of Ayurveda in the modern Indian students, and these schools are going against Ramdev ji in working for a good cause. We condemn the decision and want to convey it to the schools that look at Einstein, his hairs were long and thick and he was a genious. It would be better if students get that haircut. That way, they will become genious and our sales will also increase.\n\nYogiji has not commented on  the issue but there is a rumor that Ramdev Baba will meet Yogiji soon to convince him to stop such diktats. Now it is a matter of great curiosity whether Yogiji will let go his personal esteem in helping out Ramdevs business interest.",

      "title": "Beyond 100 days, Trump faces more legislative challenges", 
      "text": "WASHINGTON  After more than three months in office without passing any major legislation, President Donald Trump faces a week with a deadline to avert a government shutdown and the possibility of progress on health care.\n\nTrump has spent his first 100 days coming to terms with the slow grind of government even in a Republican-dominated capital, and watching some of his promises from repealing the nations health care law to temporarily banning people from some Muslim nations  fizzle.\n\nLast week lawmakers sent the president a stopgap spending bill to keep the government open through Friday. Lawmakers will continue negotiating this week on a $1 trillion package financing the government through Sept. 30, the end of the 2017 fiscal year.\n\nDespite a renewed White House effort push, the House did not vote last week on a revised bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Health Care Act.\n\nAfter the original effort failed to win enough support from conservatives and moderates, Republicans recast the bill. The latest version would let states escape a requirement under Obamas 2010 law that insurers charge healthy and seriously ill customers the same rates. The overall legislation would cut the Medicaid program for the poor, eliminate fines for people who dont buy insurance and provide generally skimpier subsidies. Critics have said the approach could reduce protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nBut during an interview with Face the Nation on CBS aired Sunday, Trump said the measure has a clause that guarantees that people with pre-existing conditions will be covered.\n\nTrump said: Pre-existing conditions are in the bill. And I just watched another network than yours, and they were saying, Pre-existing is not covered. Pre-existing conditions are in the bill. And I mandate it. I said, Has to be.'\n\nTrump said during the interview that if hes unable to renegotiate a long-standing free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, then hell terminate the pact.\n\nHe also spoke about tensions with North Korea. Asked about the failure of several North Korean missile tests recently, Trump said hed rather not discuss it. But perhaps theyre just not very good missiles. But eventually, hell have good missiles.\n\nTrump also said he is willing to use the trade issue as leverage to get Chinas help with North Korea. Trade is very important. But massive warfare with millions, potentially millions of people being killed? That, as we would say, trumps trade.\n\nAnd he acknowledged the presidency is a tough job. But Ive had a lot of tough jobs. Ive had things that were tougher, although Ill let you know that better at the end of eight years. Perhaps eight years. Hopefully, eight years.\n\nAlso this week, the president will welcome Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to the White House. And hell head to New York City on Thursday where hell visit the USS Intrepid to mark the 75th anniversary of a World War II naval battle.\n\nOn Sunday morning, Trump headed to Trump National Golf Club in Virginia. The White House did not immediately clarify whether he was holding meetings or golfing.\n\nTrump marked his 100th day in office Saturday with a rally in Harrisburg, where he continued to pledge to cut taxes and get tough on trade deals.\n\nWe are not going to let other countries take advantage of us anymore, he said Saturday in Harrisburg at the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex and Expo Center. From now on its going to be America first.\n\nTrumps rally Saturday night in Harrisburg offered a familiar recapitulation of what he and aides have argued for days are administration successes, including the successful confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, his Cabinet choices and the approval of construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.",

      "title": "When Heroin Almost Took My Life, My Phone Saved It", 
      "text": "At the end, there were only two things I cared about: the bag of heroin on my glass-topped coffee table, and the cell phone next to it. They were my two life lines. After a decade of abusing opiates, I couldnt stop using heroin. I was psychologically, physically, and emotionally dependent on it. My phone, too, was an absolute necessity. It linked me to my network  which Id started building since I worked in the White House as a young, ambitious staffer. On the last day of my drug use, I stared down at the table. To my left, the baggie. To my right, the phone.\n\nAt the time, I had no idea that one of those two things would save me from the other. Now, my phone  and, more specifically, its social media capabilities  are an intrinsic part of my new life in recovery. Its been more than two years since I got the call on my cell, telling me there was a bed available at a public detox. I took that call, and the chance to get sober. While I was in rehab, I communicated with my family and friends. I started connecting with other people in recovery online, through Facebook and Twitter. Through social media and articles I read, I learned that addiction is a chronic brain illness. Online, people were speaking up about their experience, breaking the silence of addiction. Id found my tribe  and it fit in my back pocket, or right in the palm of my hand.\n\nMy phone is how I found out my friends were dying of the health problem that I had. Early in my recovery, I lost four people who were very close to me, all within 3 months. One, Nick, was an aspiring actor. He was found in his room and had died hours earlier from a fatal overdose. Another friend, Greg, died just a few short weeks after. I will never forget getting those messages, or how I realized, days later, that my friends were only four out of hundreds of people who die every day from addiction-related issues. It seemed that, everywhere I turned, someone had lost a son, a daughter, a friend, or a mother or father. Addiction, I realized, was lethal. And staying silent was our death sentence.\n\nSitting on my bed in the Pasadena sober living home where Id finally landed, I looked down at the phone in my hand. Statistics swirled in my head. Addiction affects 1 in 3 people in the United States. Only 10% of people with addiction actually got treatment for their disease. The wait time for access to public facilities typically exceeds 30 days. I myself had frantically called multiple treatment centers, only to be told that beds werent available, and likely wouldnt be for multiple weeks. Being placed on waiting lists, knowing that my window of willingness to keep fighting for help was waning by the hour, were some of the most terrifying moments in my entire life. I knew that untreated addiction was lethal. And yet, 23 million people in the United States live in long-term recovery. People made it  but how to make that attainable for more people?\n\nOn the evening of October 4, 2015, I opened my Facebook app. And there, in my hands, was the livestream video that changed my life forever: the UNITE to Face Addiction rally on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. It sounds like a small thing, but watching that concert, which was attended by tens of thousands of people in recovery and included performances by sober artists that I grew up listening to on the radio, changed my perception of what was possible. That was my community  my people. And they were standing up for what they believed in. They werent hiding and they werent ashamed. That was the day that I stopped being a social media bystander and got involved. Id found my purpose  and once again, it was right under my nose.\n\nThe idea that social media can create massive cultural change isnt a new one. Because social media allows people to communicate freely and share information, it enables the creation of like-minded groups. If these groups are big enough, or driven enough, they have the potential to positively influence and shape cultural progress. Recent examples of this include the Green Revolution in Iran, Arab Spring, the Occupy movement, and #BlackLivesMatter protests. And, of course, the new grassroots movement to end the stigma of addiction. Our community, once marginalized and shamed into silence, had found a way to make its voice heard  and it was loud. Feeling inspired, I logged on to Facebook messenger and found Tom Coderre, a recovery advocacy change-maker and friend of Facing Addiction, the movement whose work I admired. He immediately put me in touch with co-founders Greg Williams and Jim Hood and I was on my way. I had no idea where I was going, or how I would get there, but I was going. I had a mission: to lift-up voices of people in recovery, and share the vital stories of our community.\n\nSoon, I was on the road, heading to Philadelphia for the Democratic National Convention. Hey, Id done crazier things  now, I was doing them in recovery, and for a good cause. We coined the project Addiction Across America and partnered with Facing Addiction. We were driving 3,000 miles east to speak at the convention and advocate for addiction solutions. It was a 30-day road trip through the heartland of America  communities hit hardest by the addiction crisis. I had nothing but $20, my phone, and a $100 Google Stream notebook when I came up with the idea. But I also had a road map from the people whod taken this journey of advocacy before me, and the stories kept coming. I published some of these stories in a digital web series. That was the beginning of what is now called the Voices Project.\n\nIt was also the beginning of my recovery advocacy. After the convention, and the 2016 election, I realized the tremendous influence that social media could have on how people talked, thought, acted, and even voted. I saw a way for us to transform the recovery movement into a campaign  one so big that it couldnt be ignored or silenced. So I started a Facebook page, then added Twitter and Instagram. Up front, I decided these accounts would never be about me. The point was always to raise up the voices of others. The pages began to grow. People from all over the world found me. 5,000 followers turned into 50,000. Now, that number is over 200,000 people, combined across all three platforms. But its never been about the numbers. Each one of those followers has a face, a heartbeat. They are real to me. Theyre people. Theyre a mom in Connecticut who lost her child; an incarcerated recovering heroin addict in Richmond whos a peer leader in his cell, helping others find recovery; a brave young man in Los Angeles who would come out as a person in recovery and tell his inspiring story for the first time.\n\nBefore the Voices Project, I never thought of myself as a storyteller. But I guess its who I am  and today, Im okay with that. Im a storyteller with a purpose. I didnt set out to become an advocate. I had no idea that my recovery would take me in this direction, but like so many others across this country, once I became aware of this crisis, I couldnt ignore what I saw. The injustice, prejudice, and epidemic loss of life have me mad as hell. Every day, more lives are lost; another unfair, discriminatory policy is written. So much depends on telling our stories. I cant stop. I wont. And while I dont often know what to say, I do know what to do today.\n\nAnd thats where you come in. The Voices Project proves that together we can help end the addiction crisis. We can do the work that we could never accomplish alone. Together, well end the silence and show this country that we are one of the largest constituencies ever to exist. We can inspire change, save lives, heal our communities, and build a digital movement like nobodys ever seen before. This is the #VoicesProject.",

      "title": "Trumps Syria Strike Was Constitutional", 
      "text": "In ordering Fridays strike on a Syrian airbase, President Donald J. Trump sent the U.S. military into combat without Congresss blessing. He has punished the Assad regime for its use of sarin nerve gas on its own people and only begun to correct the mistakes the Obama administration made when it allowed the Syrian civil war to metastasize into a conflict that is destabilizing the Middle East.\n\nFor its troubles, however, the Trump administration has come under fire from his conservative flank. Libertarian senator Rand Paul demands that Trump seek congressional authorization, while distinguished conservative law professor Mike Paulsen and National Review editor Kevin Williamson argue in these pages that the strikes violate the Constitution. Their arguments add to the outrage of Trump supporters, such as Ann Coulter, who tweeted: Those who wanted us meddling in the Middle East voted for other candidates.\n\nThis time, President Trump has the Constitution about right. His exercise of war powers rests firmly in the tradition of American foreign policy. Throughout our history, neither presidents nor Congresses have acted under the belief that the Constitution requires a declaration of war before the U.S. can conduct military hostilities abroad. We have used force abroad more than 100 times but declared war in only five cases: the War of 1812, the Mexican-American and Spanish-American wars, and World Wars I and II.\n\nWithout any congressional approval, presidents have sent forces to battle Indians, Barbary pirates, and Russian revolutionaries; to fight North Korean and Chinese Communists in Korea; to engineer regime changes in South and Central America; and to prevent human-rights disasters in the Balkans. Other conflicts, such as the 1991 Persian Gulf war, the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, and the 2003 Iraq War, received legislative authorization but not declarations of war. The practice of presidential initiative, followed by congressional acquiescence, has spanned both Democratic and Republican administrations and reaches back from President Trump to Presidents Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, and George Washington.\n\nCommon sense does not support replacing the way our Constitution has worked in wartime with a radically different system that mimics the peacetime balance of powers between president and Congress. If the issue were the environment or Social Security, Congress would enact policy first and the president would faithfully implement it second. But the Constitution does not duplicate this system in war. Instead, our Framers decided that the president would play the leading role in matters of national security.\n\nThose in the pro-Congress camp call upon the anti-monarchical origins of the American Revolution for support. If the Framers rebelled against King George IIIs dictatorial powers, surely they would not give the president much authority. It is true that the revolutionaries rejected the royal prerogative, and they created weak executives at the state level. Americans have long turned a skeptical eye toward the growth of federal powers. But this may mislead some to resist the fundamental difference in the Constitutions treatment of domestic and foreign affairs. For when the Framers wrote the Constitution in 1787, they rejected these failed experiments and restored an independent, unified chief executive with its own powers in national security and foreign affairs.\n\nThe most important of the presidents powers are those of commander in chief and chief executive. As Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist No. 74:\n\nPresidents should conduct war, he wrote, because they could act with decision, activity, secrecy and dispatch. In perhaps his most famous words, Hamilton wrote: Energy in the executive is a leading character in the definition of good government. . . . It is essential to the protection of the community against foreign attacks.\n\nThe Framers realized the obvious. Foreign affairs are unpredictable and involve the highest of stakes, making them unsuitable to regulation by preexisting legislation. Instead, they can demand swift, decisive action  sometimes under pressured or even emergency circumstances  that is best carried out by a branch of government that does not suffer from multiple vetoes or that is delayed by disagreements. Congress is too large and unwieldy to take the swift and decisive action required in wartime. Our Framers replaced the Articles of Confederation, which had failed in the management of foreign relations because they had no single executive, with the Constitutions single president for precisely this reason. Even when it has access to the same intelligence as the executive branch, Congresss loose, decentralized structure would paralyze American policy while foreign threats grew.\n\nCongress has no political incentive to mount and see through its own wartime policy. Members of Congress, who are interested in keeping their seats at the next election, do not want to take stands on controversial issues where the future is uncertain. They will avoid like the plague any vote that will anger large segments of the electorate. They prefer that the president take the political risks and be held accountable for failure.\n\nCongresss track record when it has opposed presidential leadership has not been a happy one. Perhaps the most telling example was the Senates rejection of the Treaty of Versailles at the end of World War I. Congresss isolationist urge kept the United States out of Europe at a time when democracies fell and Fascism grew in their place. Even as Europe and Asia plunged into war, Congress passed the Neutrality Acts designed to keep the United States out of the conflict. President Franklin Roosevelt violated those laws to help the Allies and draw the nation into war against the Axis. While pro-Congress critics worry about a presidents foreign adventurism, the real threat to our national security could come from inaction and isolationism.\n\nMany point to the Vietnam War as an example of the faults of the imperial presidency. Vietnam, however, could not have continued without the consistent support of Congress in raising a large military and paying for hostilities. And Vietnam ushered in a period of congressional dominance that witnessed American setbacks in the Cold War and the passage of the ineffectual War Powers Resolution. Congress passed the resolution in 1973 over President Richard Nixons veto, and no president has ever accepted the constitutionality of its 60-day limit on the use of troops abroad. No federal court has ever upheld the resolution. Even Congress has never enforced it.\n\nDespite the record of practice and the Constitutions institutional design, critics nevertheless argue that we should radically remake the American way of war. They typically base their claim on Congresss power to declare war. But these observers read the 18th-century constitutional text through a modern lens by interpreting declare war to mean start war. When the Constitution was written, however, a declaration of war served diplomatic notice about a change in legal relations between nations. It had little to do with launching hostilities. In the century before the Constitution, for example, Great Britain  where the Framers got the idea of declaring war  fought numerous major conflicts but declared war only once beforehand.\n\nOur Constitution sets out specific procedures for passing laws, appointing officers, and making treaties. There are none for waging war because the Framers expected the president and Congress to struggle over war through the national political process. In fact, other parts of the Constitution, properly read, support this reading. Article I, Section 10, for example, declares that the states shall not engage in war without the consent of Congress unless actually invaded, or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay. This provision creates exactly the limits desired by anti-war critics, complete with an exception for self-defense. If the Framers had wanted to require congressional permission before the president could wage war, they simply could have repeated this provision and applied it to the executive.\n\nPresidents, of course, do not have complete freedom to take the nation to war. Congress has ample powers to control presidential policy, if it wants to. Only Congress can raise the military, which gives it the power to block, delay, or modify war plans. Before 1945, the United States had such a small peacetime military that presidents who started a war would have to go hat in hand to Congress to build an army to fight it. Since World War II, Congress has authorized and funded our large standing military, one primarily designed to conduct offensive, not defensive, operations (as we learned all too tragically on 9/11) and to swiftly project power worldwide. If Congress wanted to discourage presidential initiative in war, it could build a smaller, less offense-minded military.\n\nCongresss check on the presidency lies not just in the long-term raising of the military. It can also block any immediate armed conflict through the power of the purse. If Congress feels it has been misled in authorizing war, or it disagrees with the presidents decisions, all it need do is cut off funds, either all at once or gradually. It can reduce the size of the military, shrink or eliminate units, or freeze supplies. Using the power of the purse does not even require affirmative congressional action. Congress can just sit on its hands and refuse to pass a law funding the latest presidential adventure, and the war will end quickly. Even the Kosovo war, which lasted little more than two months and involved no ground troops, required special funding legislation.\n\nThe Framers expected Congresss power of the purse to serve as the primary check on presidential war. During the 1788 Virginia ratifying convention. Patrick Henry attacked the Constitution for failing to limit executive militarism. James Madison responded: The sword is in the hands of the British king; the purse is in the hands of the Parliament. It is so in America, as far as any analogy can exist. Congress ended Americas involvement in Vietnam by cutting off all funds for the war.\n\nOur Constitution has succeeded because it favors swift presidential action in war, later checked by Congresss funding power. If a president continues to wage war without congressional authorization, as in Libya, Kosovo, or Korea, it is only because Congress has chosen not to exercise its easy check. We should not confuse a desire to escape political responsibility for a defect in the Constitution.\n\nA radical change in the system for making war might appease critics of presidential power. But it could also seriously threaten American national security. In order to forestall another 9/11 attack, or take advantage of a window of opportunity to strike terrorists or rogue nations, the executive branch needs flexibility. It is not hard to think of situations where congressional consent cannot be obtained in time to act. Time for congressional deliberation, which can lead to passivity and isolation and not smarter decisions, will come at the price of speed and secrecy.\n\nThe Constitution creates a presidency that can respond forcefully to prevent serious threats to our national security. Presidents can take the initiative, and Congress can use its funding power to check presidents. Instead of demanding a legalistic process to begin war, the Framers left war to politics. As we confront the new challenges of terrorism, rogue nations, and WMD proliferation, now is not the time to introduce sweeping, untested changes in the way we make war.\n\n John Yoo is the Heller Professor of Law at the University of California, Berkeley, and a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.",

He said later that he knew he \"lost the room early.\"\n\nIt's a unique room for a comedian, normally packed with reporters, celebrities and administration officials. But this year's WHCA dinner will be very different.\n\nIn keeping with his anti-media messaging, Trump announced in February that he would skip the dinner. Administration officials were instructed to turn down invites, too, in \"solidarity\" with the president.\n\nThis means there will be no public roasting of the president on live TV, a big change from past years.\n\nThere are also far fewer Hollywood types interested in attending the dinner and a weekend's worth of parties this year.\n\nRelated: White House Correspondents' Dinner is still on, WHCA says\n\nBut the dinner is still on.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Minhaj said, \"It is a tremendous honor to be a part of such a historic event even though the president has chosen not to attend this year. SAD! Now more than ever, it is vital that we honor the First Amendment and the freedom of the press.\"\n\nThe association usually selects an entertainer several months before the springtime event, but this year was much more fraught.\n\n\"I was not looking for somebody who was going to roast the president in absentia. That's not fair, and that's not the message that we want to get across,\" Jeff Mason, the current president of the association, said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" on Tuesday. \"I was looking for somebody who is funny and who is entertaining, because I want the dinner to be entertaining, but who can also speak to the message that the whole dinner is going to speak to ... the importance of a free press.\"\n\nCarl Bernstein and Bob Woodward will also speak about the First Amendment.\n\nMinhaj has some Washington experience -- he performed at the Radio and Television Correspondents' Dinner last year.\n\nMinhaj has been a correspondent on \"The Daily Show\" for two and a half years. He wrote and performed an off-Broadway show titled \"Homecoming King.\" Netflix will premiere a version of the one-man show this spring.",

      "text": "Russias Supreme Court has designated the Jehovahs Witnesses as an extremist organization and ordered the state to seize the religious groups property.\n\nIn a Thursday ruling, the court upheld a government request to ban the group from operating on Russian territory. The decision could place more than 170,000 Russian adherents of the Jehovahs Witnesses, a U.S.-founded Christian denomination that preaches non-violence, in the same category as militant groups Al Qaeda and the so-called Islamic State.\n\nThe decision came after six days of hearings spread over the last two weeks, during which the court reviewed a claim submitted by the Ministry of Justice in Moscow. The ministry sought to liquidate the Administrative Center of Jehovahs Witnesses in Russia, as well as 395 local branches throughout the country.\n\nThe ministry was investigating the Jehovahs Witnesses Russian headquarters near St. Petersburg over the last year and claimed it discovered violations of a Russian law banning extremism.\n\nLike Mormons, Seventh-Day Adventists and other religious minorities in the country, Jehovahs Witnesses have come under intense scrutiny under Russian anti-extremism laws that ban proselytizing and curtail the dissemination of religious literature.\n\nThe government has cracked down on the group in recent years, imposing fines on congregations and occasionally arresting leaders perceived to be stoking anti-government sentiment.\n\nIn its claim to the Russian Supreme Court, the ministry accused Jehovahs Witnesses of disseminating extremist pamphlets and said the center and all regional facilities should be liquidated.\n\nOne pamphlet the ministry reportedly took issue with quoted the novelist Leo Tolstoy and described the beliefs of the Russian Orthodox Church as superstition and sorcery, according to the BBC.\n\nYaroslav Sivulskiy, a spokesman for Jehovahs Witnesses in Russia, said he was greatly disappointed by the courts decision.\n\nWe will appeal this decision, and we hope that our legal rights and protections as a peaceful religious group will be fully restored as soon as possible, Sivulskiy said in a statement.",

      "title": "4 rules for making a protest work, according to experts", 
      "text": "Saturday saw thousands of Americans hit the streets for the March for Science to protest President Trumps proposal to cut billions in funding for scientific research. This mobilization came three months after millions joined in Womens Marches across the country and separate protests of President Donald Trumps executive order banning immigrants and refugees from entering the country. More mass demonstrations are in the works.\n\nWhile these recent protests have channeled opposition to the new presidents campaign rhetoric and first round of executive orders, scholars say its critical that todays protesters learn from history about how protests can succeed  and how they can fail.\n\nProtests can turn to social movements, but they often fail in an immediate way, Seamus Power, a psychologist who has done intensive study of austerity protests in Ireland, says. And history is full of examples of protests that fail. The Occupy Wall Street movement sought to highlight growing income inequality in America. It made a lot of noise but didnt lead to lasting changes. The Arab Spring revolution in Egypt replaced one dictator with another. In the early 2000s, liberals made a noisy plea to end the Iraq War. The war outlived the decade.\n\nProtest is not enough, Fabio Rojas, a sociologist at Indiana University, said in an email. Protests can make a lot of noise, but if they dont influence powerful people making decisions, they fail.\n\nIf a protest fails, it can embolden opponents. Occupy Wall Street was beloved by leftists, but synonymous in the minds of many Americans with disorder, crude behavior, and a message that no one, even its organizers, could explain, Tom Nichols, a Naval War College professor and author of The Death of Expertise, explains. Which is why it's not around anymore as a mass movement.\n\nSo how can protest movements make truly lasting changes? They need to be disciplined, persistent, action-oriented, and focused, experts tell me. Here are four overarching guidelines.\n\nPredicting the effectiveness of protests is difficult. Its so hard to directly link the actions of demonstrators to bills getting passed or leaders making changes. Its such a chaotic, complex system, Pamela E. Oliver, a sociologist at the University of Wisconsin, explains. Imagine a sporting event where there are 12 teams on the field, and they all have their own agendas. Its impossible to guess the outcome.\n\nBut the research does find a consistent trend: The longer and louder a protest persists, the more likely the government is to take action.\n\nDaniel Q. Gillion, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania and author of The Political Power of Protest, has focused his career on figuring out whether a protest can make a real change. The answer is that it does, he says.\n\nBut its not that easy. Conservatives can point to the current mass gatherings and smear them as fringe  unruly mobs of political correctness gone wild. A protest can embolden politicians to stay the course, and conservative politicians like Trump might be emboldened, said Gillion.\n\nFor a protest to spur change, he finds, it has to become unignorable.\n\nIn his studies of decades worth of minority activism, Gillion has identified several factors that are key to upping a protests salience and, in turn, making real political change.\n\nFor these more violent categories, Gillion doesnt make the distinction of whether the violence was incited by the protesters, counterprotesters, or law enforcement. The bigger idea is that reports of death or injury alone draw attention. I want to be clear that [violence] leads to increased attention in the way that large crowds lead to attention, in the way that persistence over time leads to attention, he says.\n\nThe more salient a protest is, the more likely Congress is to vote on bills that support the demonstrators, Gillion says. On average, every time a politician becomes informed of 10 protest events happening in their district, they become 1 percent more likely to support a bill that favors a protesters position.\n\nIf a new protest springs up every time Trump makes a controversial move, it could mean that each individual protest will get diluted.\n\nIf Trump has more executive orders tomorrow, that are all extreme with regards to womens rights and the environment [and so on], it could split the coalition, said Dana Fisher, a sociologist at the University of Maryland studying the ongoing anti-Trump protest movement. Theres only so much time you have in a day to participate in democracy.\n\nOne solution for dilution, Fisher says, is to form a coalition under one protest. She says the Womens March did this really effectively. Yes, it was formed to vocalize womens right concerns. But it also embraced a coalition of people concerned about a whole suite of progressive issues, she says\n\nDuring the Womens March, she sent out eight researchers to randomly sample demonstrators with a questionnaire. Her preliminary data finds that in addition to supporting womens issues, 21 percent were there to protest Trumps attitude toward immigration, 23 percent were concerned with social welfare, and 34.7 percent were there for LGBTQ issues. So theres a big group of people who want to advocate for the same spate of values. The question is then how to channel that into meaningful political action, she says.\n\nEnergy, emotion, and people can certainly make social change, Fisher says. But the energy, emotion, and the people have to be channeled into tactics that are effective.\n\nIts not enough to just shout in the streets to make social change. This may be especially true of the Trump administration. In the past, Voxs Dylan Matthews writes, presidents have been responsive to changes in popular opinion. Which all make it quite disturbing that Donald Trump appears to believe approval ratings are rigged.\n\nI think of democracy as a dialogue, Power, the psychologist, says. Trump got elected, in part, because certain groups of people felt left behind. And now liberals are responding in the form of protests against Trumps protectionist policies. It's an ongoing dialogue. ... But Trump doesn't listen.\n\nProtesters shouldnt expect Trump to relent based on their pickets alone. Instead, they may want to target their messaging and actions to senators who could deny Trumps Cabinet or Supreme Court appointments. Or they could find ways to generate political or market pressure to get Trump to change his decisions.\n\nDuring the civil rights movement, Fisher reminds, people didnt just show up for a march on Washington. They had specific plans of action to put political pressure on politicians to address their concerns. There were boycotts, freedom rides, acts of nonviolent resistance, walkouts, and more. Fisher also points to the anti-apartheid movement in the 1980s, where students pressured their universities to divest money from South African companies. Those were specific targets of the protest movement that were thought to move the needle.\n\nThe whole goal of a protest movement is to create a political moment that decision-makers  the people in power  just cant ignore. And protesters need to get creative in how to make that moment.\n\nOne criticism of the current spate of protests is that it lacks a leader. But Gillion isnt sure if an effective protest movement needs a clear leader.\n\nIn some cases, leadership can be detrimental, because people tend to characterize attributes of the protest based on the leader, he says. It doesnt need a leader, but it should have a direction. It should have some grievances that are put out.\n\nOliver notes that proactive protests  in which demonstrators are trying to prevent an action from happening  tend to be more effective than reactive protests, where people mobilize in response to an outrage. Reactive protests  like the one in response to Trumps immigration executive order  tend to move the needle incrementally. Arguably, protesters over the weekend put pressure on the White House to clarify whether green card holders are included in the travel ban, for instance.\n\nAnd the reactive protests made waves in another way: The American Civil Liberties Union, which filed a lawsuit on behalf of immigrants stuck in executive order limbo, received $24.1 million in donations over the weekend. Thats six times the amount it usually gets in an entire year. Its money to employ more lawyers and take more legal action against Trumps policies.\n\nA larger, more proactive movement may be necessary to try to get Trump to revoke the ban altogether.\n\nBut even if the current protests against Trump are not yet aimed toward specific plans of action or goals, they are doing something important. The protest is also an opportunity to create what we call collective identity, Fisher says. Its about getting sympathizers, people who agree with the cause, to be activists.\n\nIf people who are showing up to protests just because they are curious and sympathetic eventually move on to greater, more consistent action, the movement grows. And change can happen.",
