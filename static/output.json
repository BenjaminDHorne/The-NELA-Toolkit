      "text": "People are rescued by airboat as they evacuate from flood waters from Hurricane Harvey in Dickinson, Texas August 27, 2017. (Photo: Rick Wilking/REUTERS)(\n\nThe city of Dickinson, Texas, will no longer require private citizens affected by Hurricane Harvey to sign a pledge guaranteeing they do not and will not boycott Israel as a condition to receiving help.\n\nAfter a closed meeting with city attorney David Olson, the city council passed a motion to remove a clause that conditions disaster relief aid on an applicants political views.\n\nWhile a clear victory for residents of Dickinson  if perhaps bittersweet because the storm-struck are simply back to where the application process should have begun  the amendment only applies to private homeowners.\n\nThe council voted to strike the language related to the pledge not to boycott Israel for residential applicants for the grants, city management assistant Bryan Milward told Mondoweiss. However, Milward confirmed, the language is still in for businesses.\n\nCity businesses damaged by the storm are still prohibited from engaging in any boycott of Israel if they are to receive relief funding. According to the city police department, the hurricane seriously damaged 88 businesses, ten of which are closing down indefinitely.\n\nCouncilman Walter Wilson, who brought the issue up for a vote after reconvening, noted that the move really doesnt change the application itself...well remove that clause when were entering into that agreement with an individual homeowner.\n\nBut when it comes to businesses boycotting Israel is verboten.\n\nWhenever [the city] is dealing with companies, Wilson said, which he noted are more broadly defined, we will continue to maintain [the no-Israel-boycott pledge] until we receive guidance from a higher court or a state agency issuing an opinion.\n\nSo while private residents are seemingly spared for now, it remains to be seen how the anti-boycott stipulation will affect the daily operations of the 20,000 or so residents who rely on businesses in the city in some way  either as consumers or owners.\n\nFor example, 20% of businesses in the city are in the construction field, according to publicly available data. Should the city deny any number of these companies relief grants, it stands to reason that this will negatively affect the economy and have a domino effect on rebuilding efforts.\n\nDickinson City Attorney David Olson has maintained from the beginning that the clause prohibiting the boycott of Israel, present or future, was included in the agreement to ensure compliance with recently implemented Texas state law.\n\nIn May, Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott signed legislation known as the Anti-BDS bill.\n\nThe law, which became effective on September 1, 2017, requires the state to create a blacklist of private companies that boycott Israel. It also prohibits all state agencies from contracting with or investing in those companies.\n\nDickinsons turnaround on individual boycotters is likely a result of widespread, negative media coverage and a steady stream of rebuke from legal and civil liberties organizations across the country. But the infusion of pro-Israel politics into state legislation doesnt appear to be slowing.\n\nYousef Munayyer, Executive Director of the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights said in a statement: We welcome the news that the City of Dickinson has decided to remove a requirement to pledge not to boycott Israel to receive hurricane relief aid. Political views on Israel, or on anything for that matter, should never be used by governments to deny equal treatment to American citizens. Discriminatory policies denying equality to Palestinians are precisely what those of us calling for the use of boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) are aiming to end.\n\nUnfortunately, such discriminatory requirements remain in state contracts across the country, including in Texas, added Munayyer, due to a pernicious nationwide effort to use the law as an instrument to stifle non-violent dissent against Israeli policies.\n\nTwenty-one states already have anti-BDS legislation on the books. Less than a week after the news about Dickinson broke, Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland signed an executive order nearly identical to the offending Texas law.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which does not take a stance on BDS itself, has called the boycott requirement unconstitutional and is currently defending a teacher against similar legislation in Kansas.\n\nACLU staff attorney Brian Hauss reacted to the recent developments in a statement provided to Mondoweiss:\n\nNumerous states throughout the country have passed anti-boycott laws similar to the one in Texas. The laws in places like Texas and Arizona are particularly broad because they apply to local governments in addition to state agencies. As recent events in Dickinson and elsewhere have shown, these laws are being applied to condition access to important government funds, ranging from disaster relief to neighborhood maintenance projects, on an unconstitutional certification about protected boycott activity. Any law that denies government contracts or other benefits to people participating in protected boycott activity violates the First Amendment.",

      "title": "Dickinson demands Hurricane Harvey victims agree to not boycott Israel", 
      "text": "Ali Khalili plans to apply for aid from the city of Dickinson to make repairs to his home after it was inundated with water from Hurricane Harvey, but he isn't optimistic his request will be approved.\n\nThe reason? The 75-year-old's politics, including past boycotts and protests of Israel's policies.\n\nA recently passed state law prohibits Texas governmental entities  including cities  from contracting with or investing certain public funds in companies that boycott Israel.\n\n\"Anti-Israel policies are anti-Texas policies, and we will not tolerate such actions against an important ally,\" Gov. Greg Abbott said in a news release earlier this year.\n\nDickinson's application for aid to rebuild homes and businesses requires residents to state that they will not boycott Israel during the term of the agreement, according to a form on the city's website.\n\nThe ACLU has called the requirement \"an egregious violation of the First Amendment.\"\n\n\"We were frankly appalled that the city of Dickinson would be imposing a sort of political litmus test on hurricane relief funds,\" said Brian Hauss, a New York-based ACLU staff attorney.\n\nDickinson's city attorney told KTRK-TV that the city included that provision to comply with the recently passed Anti-Boycott, Divestments and Sanctions law.\n\nIt's unclear, though, that the city needs to require private citizens not to boycott Israel. Advising cities on how best to comply with the state law has proved challenging, said Scott Houston, general counsel for the Texas Municipal League.\n\nThe league recommended to cities this fall that they include the language about Israel in written contracts with companies. Whether the definition of companies can be expanded to include private citizens, such as Harvey victims, isn't clear, Houston added.\n\n\"I don't know what the answer is,\" Houston said. He added that he defers to local city attorneys to determine if the clause is necessary.\n\nDickinson's mayor and city manager did not respond to requests for comment Friday.\n\nHauss, with the ACLU, said he could not comment on whether Dickinson's interpretation of the law was valid.\n\nHowever, Hauss added, the ACLU views House Bill 89 as unconstitutional as well.\n\n\"The First Amendment protects Americans' right to boycott, and the government cannot condition hurricane relief or any other public benefit on a commitment to refrain from protected political expression,\" said ACLU of Texas Legal Director Andre Segura. \"Dickinson's requirement is an egregious violation of the First Amendment, reminiscent of McCarthy-era loyalty oaths requiring Americans to disavow membership in the Communist party and other forms of 'subversive' activity.\"\n\nThe BDS movement began in 2005 as a nonviolent protest of Israel's treatment of Palestinians. It included a call to boycott and divest from companies that it states are involved in the violation of Palestinian human rights.\n\nThe movement has brought pushback from members of Congress. Earlier this year, the Israel Anti-Boycott Act was introduced in the House and Senate. Similar measures have been introduced in states including Texas.\n\nIn a statement, the Houston branch of the Anti-Defamation League, which supports state resolutions opposing BDS, said it was \"deeply troubled\" to learn about the application in Dickinson.\n\n\"This requirement is misguided and constitutionally problematic,\" the statement read. \"And reveals an unanticipated and unfortunate consequence of a well-intentioned state anti-BDS law that needs further consideration.\"\n\nOther Texas cities have already taken steps to comply with the state's law, though it hasn't come up in the context of flood relief.\n\nGalveston, Austin and San Antonio have put the language in place involving contracts for some public projects, Hauss said. Houston has also required that contractors and suppliers verify in new contracts that they are not boycotting Israel, said Alan Bernstein, a spokesman for Mayor Sylvester Turner.\n\nThere haven't been any changes in contractors or suppliers since the law was put in place, Bernstein added.\n\nWhile the city of Houston does not have a city-administered Hurricane Harvey relief fund comparable to Dickinson's, Houston's legal department has not advised that the law applies to private individuals, Bernstein said.\n\nThe ACLU is fighting a similar law in Kansas. In October, the nonprofit filed a lawsuit challenging a Kansas statute that required a math teacher selected to participate in state training to sign a certificate that she would not boycott Israel, Hauss said.\n\nThe civil rights group has not yet filed a lawsuit in connection with a case in Texas, but is asking residents affected by HB 89 to contact them, Hauss said.\n\nAs for Khalili, he said a contractor estimated his repairs would reach $30,000. The Dickinson resident of more than 30 years doesn't have flood insurance to foot the bill.\n\nEven though he needs the money, Khalili said he would take his chances and cross out the portion of the application agreeing not to boycott Israel.\n\nKhalili has participated in demonstrations and boycotts in the past, both related to and unrelated to the BDS movement, he said. He views it as his civic duty.\n\nAgreeing to restrict that, Khalili said, \"is un-American.\"",

      "title": "IMF refuses Barbuda debt relief after hurricane devastation, Cuba dispatches medical staff across Caribbean", 
      "text": "As Barbuda, part of the Caribbean island nation of Antigua and Barbuda, reels from having almost the entirety of its infrastructure and 95% of its homes destroyed due to Hurricane Irma, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has rejected a moratorium proposal to discuss the island's US$3 million dollar debt.\n\nThe IMF's refusal to even converse about funds owed by the tiny Caribbean island was made clear by Christopher Lane, the financial institution's special representative to the United Nations, according to Courthouse News. Our general view is that we'd rather put new money in than to have a moratorium, Lane said.\n\nSpeaking in a conference room situated in the basement of the U.N.'s Secretariat Building, Lane further exemplified the IMF's position by stating that the institution may borrow funds from the United States and loan them to Antigua.\n\n\"If we don't get paid back on time, we'd have to make an arrangement with the source of the funds themselves. It gets a bit arcane, but there's a number of constraints on how we operate,\" Lane added. \"We're like a bank. We borrow and lend.\"\n\nAntigua was spared from Hurricane Irma's devastating and deadly churn, but the eye of the storm passed directly over Barbuda. Prime Minister Gaston Browne characterised the storm as landing like a bomb over Barbuda.\n\nThe IMF may be unmoved to forgive, or even discuss, the terms of Barbuda's debt, but Cuba has dispatched a medical brigade and Venezuela is airlifting over 10 tons of supplies as well as rescue personnel to the ravished island.\n\nMore than 750 Cuban physicians have been dispatched to several Caribbean islands in the wake of Hurricane Irma's destruction.\n\nThey will maintain daily communication with Havana in order to stay informed about unfolding events, said Dr. Regla Angulo Pardo, director of Cubas Central Unit of Medical Cooperation.\n\nShe noted that Cuba has sent medical brigades to six of the countries in the subregion that, in recent days, have been or will be in the the tropical storm's orbit. Those islands include Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Bahamas, Dominica and Haiti.\n\nIn Haiti, heavy rains forced nine of 23 total collaborators to evacuate their locations. However, the remaining medical staff are assisting local health authorities and serving residents.\n\nPardo emphasised that in Barbuda, Cuba's 43 physicians weathered the storm unscathed and have joined recovery efforts.",

      "title": "Petrochemical giants dumped deadly carcinogens during Hurricane Harvey", 
      "text": "As Hurricane and Tropical Storm Harvey bore down on and flooded the northern Gulf Coast last month with an estimated 20 trillion gallons of rain, some 60 plants belonging to the worlds petrochemical giants on the Texas coast began shutdown procedures. During this time they vented and dumped almost a million pounds of some of the most deadly chemical compounds on earth.\n\nTotal air pollutants from all oil and gas facilities added up to 5.6 million pounds, according to an analysis released September 1 by the Center for Biological Diversity. The deadly cocktail that included benzene, hexane, sulfur dioxide, 1,3-butadiene, and xylene were dumped or spilled during the storm by ExxonMobil, Shell, and Chevron Phillips and other petrochemical giants over a period of eight days beginning August 23.\n\nReports filed by the refining industry with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) confirmed that residents of Harris County and the surrounding area sustained 61 percent of the un-permitted emissions of toxic dumping than occurred in all of 2016. The dumping of these compounds included over 13 tons of benzene.\n\nSignificantly, Houston, Texas has never met national air quality standards since the passage of the Clean Air Act of 1970.\n\nWhen TCEQ spokeswoman Andrea Morrow was queried about the findings, she was quoted as saying, All measured concentrations were well below levels of health concern, and that local residents should not be concerned about air quality issues related to the effects of the storm. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) stated it was observing the situation with air quality buses, though how this was done in the midst of a flood was not explained.\n\nAccording to a Las Vegas Review-Journal article appearing September 8, the chief Houston Health Department scientist Loren Raun reported that a department air quality monitor measured an astonishing level of 14,000 parts per billion of volatile organic compounds downwind of the Valero Partners refinery on Houstons east side, where a heavy roof had collapsed into a reservoir of stored chemicals during the storm.\n\nFor the duration of the storm-related events, Texas Governor Greg Abbott decreed a temporary suspension of emission regulations. The states air quality monitors were also shut off, with the initial explanation that officials made this decision to prevent damage to the expensive instrumentation. Later, air quality spokespersons began telling the press the monitors were damaged during the storm.\n\nRuben Basurto, a 33-year-old construction worker living two blocks from the refinery reported that the smell drove him and his friends indoors. Cindy Sanchez, 32, told the press that she became sick to her stomach and had eye burning. Nearby Galena Park mothers opened a Facebook page to describe their illnesses, saying the discharge smelled like sweet gasoline, or raw sewage in very thick air.\n\nA local environmental activist Juan Flores said, a lot of people are afraid to talk, because their husbands work at the plants. He also said many of the residents near the refineries want to see a doctor, but they have no insurance or means to pay.\n\nDaniel Cohan, an environmental scientist at Rice University, pointed out that the refineries, during a significant storm, delay shutdown until the very last moment. When the event is passed, they restart quickly, causing a very dramatic surge in emissions. He added, These plants are three to four decades old, and that the facilities are outmoded and badly overdue for modernization.\n\nIn 2010, ExxonMobil, Chevron-Phillips, and Shell were sued by the Sierra Club and Environment Texas, and this May were ordered by a federal judge to pay a settlement of $27.8 million. ExxonMobils share was $19.9 million and the energy conglomerate filed an appeal.\n\nThe federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) issued a Public Health Statement in August, 2007 regarding benzene, noting that it is a colorless liquid with a sweet odor, which can be smelled by humans at about 60 parts per million (ppm) of air, and correctly identified at 100 ppm. Benzene can be tasted in water at 0.5-4.5 ppm, and 1 ppm is about 1 drop in 40 gallons of water. It is in the top 20 chemicals produced in the US, used in making plastic foam and other plastics, some types of rubber, lubricants, dyes, detergents, drugs, and pesticides. It is also present in crude oil, gasoline and cigarettes.\n\nBenzene is also slightly soluble in water, and will make its way from soil into aquifers. About 20 percent of human exposure in the US is from auto exhaust and industrial emissions. Fifty percent enters the body by breathing, and lesser amounts by ingestion and through the skin. Its human metabolites include phenol, muconic acid, and S-phenylmercapturic acid, which are known to cause leukemia and liver cancers.\n\nAt least a quarter million workers are significantly exposed to benzene in the US petrochemical and refining industry, tire manufacturing, shoe making, printing, in lab technology, fire fighting, and gasoline stations.\n\nA 5-10 minute respiratory exposure to benzene can be fatal at air levels of 10,000-20,000 ppm. The compound will produce dizziness, nausea, headaches, rapid heartbeat, drowsiness, and unconsciousness at 700-3000 ppm. The US Department of Health and Human Services, the EPA, and the International Agency for Cancer Research identify benzene as a carcinogen. High levels of benzene inhaled by female workers has produced irregular menses, and has been linked to fetal changes and damaged immune and central nervous systems in experimental animals.\n\nThe EPA has estimated that the regular drinking of benzene-contaminated water at 10 ppm, or breathing air with 0.4 ppm would account for one added cancer per 100,000 people annually. The EPA also requires the National Response Center to investigate a spill into the environment of 10 pounds or more of benzene.\n\nIn August, 2008, the Environmental Health Perspective Journal published the results of a study titled Childhood Lymphohematopoietic Cancer Incidence and Hazardous Air Pollutants in Southeast Texas, 1995-2004. The investigation found in a review of 997 cases of childhood blood and lymphatic systems cancers that Census tracts (from Houston, Texas and the surrounding eight counties) with the highest benzene levels had elevated rates of all leukemia(s). The studys conclusion reads, Our ecologic analysis suggests an association between childhood leukemia and hazardous air pollution.\n\nBakeyah Nelson, executive director of Air Alliance in Houston told the Guardian, Its really a serious public health crisis from pollution and other impacts people are facing. Communities in close proximity to these facilities will get the worst of it, as they get the worst of it on a daily basis. Theres also the acute danger of one of these facilities exploding in neighborhoods where storage tanks are adjacent to peoples backyards. Its a very real threat and its a vey precarious situation.\n\nThe Guardian quoted Bryan Parras, who grew up in and lives in the low income East End, These people have very little political power and the city knows it. The real disaster is that they are poisoning these communities slowly, 24-7.\n\nA September 5 New York Times article reported that Arkema Company, the French-owned firm whose plant exploded and burned in Crosby, Texas during Hurricane Harvey, had little in its emergency flood plans for power loss to its cooling equipment for storage of organic peroxides, its main product, sold to plastics manufacturers. Company vice president Gilles Galinier in Crosby insisted, It is not an industrial accident, instead blaming the severity of the storms, despite the Houston area having experienced so-called 500-year floods each of the last three years. The company worldwide had sales last year of $8.9 billion.\n\nAfter Hurricane Ike in 2008, Arkema conceded hurricanes and resulting floods were a plant safety issue. But when flood plans were filed with the EPA, there were no provisions for elevating backup generators above the floodwater line. The flooding of emergency generators last month led to the explosions and chemical fires.\n\nAt the onset of Harvey, 11 of the 50 Arkema workers in Crosby hurriedly transferred the organic peroxides from the overheated plant building to nine outside refrigerated tanker trucks. The tankers were moved to the highest spot on the Arkema grounds and as far as possible from tanks of sulfur dioxide, a very corrosive gas, and other tanks of isobutylene, a very flammable gas. As it was, all nine tanker trailers and 18 tons of organic peroxides were consumed by fire.\n\nTom Neltner of the Environmental Defense Fund noted, They (Arkema) identify new hazards, but dont change anything in their plans.\n\nThe EPAs risk management in fact ignores volatile explosive compounds, requiring companies to address risk for 150 identified chemicals selected for flammability and toxicity, but not reactivity. The unstable compound ammonium nitrate is not on the EPA list of monitored chemicals, and caused the 2013 explosion of a fertilizer plant that killed 15 people in the town of West, Texas.\n\nThe World Socialist Web Site spoke with a retired oil worker from the ExxonMobil refinery in Beaumont, Texas. The major refiners are on the Neches River. The Exxon plant in Beaumont and a nearby chemical plant share a water containment facility. Im sure it overflowed into the river. The public doesnt hear about runoff and seepage, but the workers in the facility know about oil and processed fluids that are floating underneath us and getting into the ground. You dont hear about the health of workers either.",

      "title": "To Get Hurricane Rebuilding Money in Texas, Contractors Must Promise They Wont Boycott Israel", 
      "text": "Texan looking to rebuild in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, youd better not boycott Israel.\n\nThats the message being sent by the state, which has banned any contractor who supports the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions, or BDS, campaign from receiving state funds.\n\nIf youre confused why the two things are related, look to a bill that Texass Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law in July. House Bill 89 prohibits the state from entering into contract with a business unless it does not boycott Israel; and will not boycott Israel during the term of the contract. The law applies even to businesses that would refuse to buy products made in illegal Israeli settlements on Palestinian land  as it defines Israel as both Israel proper and Israeli-controlled territory.\n\nTo see how this law works in practice, check out a sample application for a Harvey rebuilding contract from the city of Dickinson, Texas. The contract includes a section that requires the applicant to verify that they do not currently boycott Israel and will not do so during the duration of the contract:\n\nTexass law is similar to the Kansas law that went into force this past summer. Under that law, a teacher is being punished for following her Mennonite Churchs guidance to boycott some companies that do business related to Israels occupation of the Palestinians. The American Civil Liberties Union has filed suit, saying that the law is unconstitutional.\n\nAs part of its legal complaint, the ACLU is citing the 1982 Supreme Court decision NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co. This case revolved around a group of NAACP activists and others, who boycotted certain white merchants over demands for desegregation. The white merchants took legal action to attempt to recoup damages from the boycott. The case went all the way up to the Supreme Court, which unanimously decided that the government cant prohibit politically motivated boycotts.\n\nIt is absolutely unconscionable for state and local governments to impose political litmus tests on disaster relief funds for people devastated by Hurricane Harvey, Brian Hauss, an ACLU staff attorney based in New York, told The Intercept. In this case, the City of Dickinson seems to be enforcing a Texas law that requires any state contractor, apparently including disaster relief recipients, to certify that they are not participating in boycotts of Israel. Like the law we challenged in Kansas, Texass law clearly violates the First Amendment. The government should not be denying disaster relief funds based on peoples political beliefs. We urge anyone asked to sign this certification to contact the ACLU of Texas.\n\nAyesha Khan lives in Houston and has been active in the BDS movement since her time as a student at the University of California, Los Angeles. She noted to The Intercept that the national conference for Students for Justice in Palestine  one of the leading organizations that advocates for BDS  will be in Houston this year.\n\nKhan has been active in the rebuilding efforts since Harvey hit and worries that the law may complicate recovery. A lot of people are actually still homeless, families are still in temporary shelters, she said. I think, if anything, this just prolongs the time for homes to be back in refurbishing and how long families take to go back home.",

      "title": "Video Shows Where Puerto Rico's Aid Went (Spoiler: It's In A Dumpster In Puerto Rico)", 
      "text": "In light of the outcry from one particularly vocal Democratic mayor in Puerto Rico about relief efforts after Hurricane Maria, a video is quickly making its way across the internet purportedly showing what happened to many of the supplies sent to help the locals who were devastated by the storm.\n\nThe video's description reads, \"Fully packed meals in Trash Dumpster in Patilla, P.R. and Starvation still in effect in most of the island\":\n\nThe video shows a man shocked to find what looks like a shipping container-sized bin filled with box after box of unopened meals that have been discarded. When the camera pans, you can see a semi-truck trailer right behind the dumpster, which raises the question, \"Did those supplies go straight from the truck to the trash?\"\n\nIt turns out the man in the dumpster happens to be the Secretary of State of Puerto Rico, Luis Rivera Marin, who then spoke to CBS News Correspondent David Begnaud about what he found:\n\nMarin states: \"We got tipped about the mishandling of some of the supplies in a distribution center in Patilla, and we were able to corroborate what we didn't want to see. In a garbage dump truck we found pallets full of meals ready to be distributed at one time but now all spoiled. They were left under the rain in the open air under the sun subject to rodents and animals.\"\n\nJust two weeks ago, San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz gave an impassioned speech calling out President Trump for what she sees as sub-par relief efforts while standing in front of pallets of unopened supplies donated by companies.\n\nAs NBC reported at the time,\n\nThe mayor of Puerto Rico's largest city was rebuked by President Donald Trump on Saturday after pleading for more federal assistance in the wake of Hurricane Maria. \"We are dying, and you are killing us with the inefficiency and the bureaucracy,\" San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz said Friday at a news conference. She highlighted donations from companies and others, including 200,000 pounds of food donated by Goya, as a contrast to federal help. \"This is what we got last night: four pallets of water, three pallets of meals and 12 pallets of infant food  which I gave them to the people of Comerio, where people are drinking off a creek,\" she said. \"So I am done being polite. I am done being politically correct. I am mad as hell.\"",

      "title": "Why Didn't FPL Do More to Prepare for Irma?", 
      "text": "Four days after Irma, millions of Floridians are still stuck without power in the sweltering summer heat. Those outages have now killed eight elderly people trapped in a Hollywood nursing home without air conditioning, due to circumstances that FPL was warned about at least two days before the tragedy.\n\nMany of those powerless residents are now asking hard questions of the area's power monopoly, which has spent millions of dollars fighting policies that would have strengthened the grid in the event of a major storm like Irma and, more broadly, stemmed the carbon-fueled climate change likely fueling monster storms.\n\n\"I am one of the many that now been without power for more than two days as a result of Hurricane Irma,\" Elise McKenna, a West Palm Beach resident, told New Times via email. \"My confusion came when so many of us lost power during the early hours of the storm that basically avoided us. We've been told time and time again that rate increases were to help prepare us for future storms.\"\n\nMcKenna is far from alone. FPL's workers on the ground seem to be doing all they can to fix downed lines and restore power to homes, and they deserve huge credit for working around the clock in awful conditions.\n\nBut the company's corporate and government-relations wings have serious questions to answer this week after quashing regulations that could have made the energy grid stronger at a slight expense to FPL's billion-dollar bottom line.\n\nHurricane Wilma, the last 'cane to hit South Florida, tore through the area in 2005 and killed power to 3.24 million of FPL's then-4.3 million customers (75 percent of the grid). Many of those customers had to wait up to two weeks for power to return. Since then, the company has spent more than $2 billion supposedly girding itself against the next storm, according to a Sun Sentinel piece published before Irma hit.\n\n\n\nBut after Irma, which by most reports brought only Category 1-strength winds to South Florida, by some measures the company did even worse. Despite all of those upgrades, an even larger percentage of FPL's customer base  4.4 of 4.9 million customers, almost 90 percent  lost electricity this past weekend.\n\nGranted, Wilma and Irma were different storms: Irma was larger and South Florida with its powerful dirty side. During Wilma, many Miamians were trapped without power for two weeks or more, and FPL promises it will fix most of Florida's east coast within a week. But the company also says harder-hit customers on the state's Gulf Coast could be out of power for 12 days or more. The same would likely have been true in Miami had Irma's churned through Dade County instead of Naples.\n\nEven worse, some of FPL's highly touted storm-ready technology didn't work after Irma.\n\nBefore the hurricane hit, FPL directed residents to regularly check its mobile app and online service map to see if their homes had power  but on Tuesday, FPL was forced to apologize after many residents said they were either unable to access the map or were repeatedly given inaccurate information. (Two New Times reporters were given wrong info this week  one was told her power was back on, only to travel home and find out she was still in the dark.)\n\n\"Communication systems across Florida were impacted by Irma, causing issues with our reporting systems,\" FPL's website said Tuesday. \"We apologize if you were provided with incorrect status updates. We ask that you please re-report your outage if your power is still out.\"\n\nThe fiasco, naturally, has angered some Floridians, who are already fairly ornery after being trapped in homes without air conditioning and hot water for multiple days.\n\n\"The website gives no indication as to when individuals can expect power to be restored,\" McKenna, the reader in West Palm, says. \"Their official, statement says 'end of the upcoming weekend.' How are things this bad after tropical storm winds and spotty Cat 1 gusts? FPL is not doing right by our community, and no one is doing anything about it.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, FPL President Eric Silagy asked \"folks to be patient\" with the company after the storm.\n\nBut many Floridians wonder if of residents without power and flubbed website are just the latest signs that the company has spent way too much on lobbying and government affairs and not nearly enough on hurricane-proofing the power grids it maintains in some of the most storm-prone areas of the world.\n\nFPL and its parent company, NextEra Energy, have for years heavily influenced state and local politics through donations, making billions in profits each year ($1.7 billion alone in 2016) thanks to favorable state laws that are sometimes literally written by the power company's own lobbyists.\n\nFPL's lobbying wing has fought hard against letting Floridians power their own homes with solar panels. The company spent millions pushing Amendment 1, which would have ultimately made it harder for homeowners to embrace solar technology.\n\nThanks to power-company rules, it's expensive in Florida to simply buy a solar panel and power your individual home with it.\n\n \n\nFPL's online rules also say that if the power goes out, your solar-power system must power down along with the rest of the grid if it does not have a set of backup batteries installed along with it. (Update: As Snopes and FPL have pointed out, this rule results from national safety guidelines for utilities.)\n\n\"Renewable generator systems connected to the grid without batteries are not a standby power source during an FPL outage,\" the company's solar-connection rules state. \"The system must shut down when FPL's grid shuts down in order to prevent dangerous back feed on FPL's grid. This is required to protect FPL employees who may be working on the grid.\"\n\nThe law winds up forcing residents to remain reliant on the state's private power companies. For now, solar-panel owners can still get something out of the law, in that the \"net-metering\" provision lets you sell excess power back to the company. The provision also lets power companies charge a $400 or $1,000 application fee for consumers who want to install systems more powerful than 10 kilowatts.\n\nBut if power companies had their way, the net-metering law would vanish tomorrow. Both FPL and its trade association, the Edison Electric Institute, have spent millions trying to kill that net-metering law and instead win the right to charge you for installing your own solar-panel system. In 2016, FPL spent more than $8 million on Amendment 1, a ballot initiative that industry insiders admitted was written to trick customers into giving up their rights to solar power. The law's language would have paved the way for Florida to kill net-metering rules.\n\nThis past April, the Energy and Policy Institute caught an FPL lobbyist straight-up drafting anti-solar laws for Fort Myers state Rep. Ray Rodrigues, who also took a $15,000 campaign contribution from FPL this year.\n\nThanks to power-company influence, one of America's sunniest states lags far behind the rest of the nation when it comes to solar adoption.\n\nFPL has also resisted some seemingly foolproof solutions to avoid storm outages, such as burying more lines. In a city that names its sports teams for hurricanes, a huge portion of FPL's power lines still sit above-ground and get blown apart even in tropical storm conditions.\n\nThe company's stubborn stance on burying lines has been on full display in an ongoing fight over 88 miles of new power lines it wants to build connecting to the Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station in Homestead. That battle has dragged on for the better part of this decade, all because FPL has refused to bury lines. In 2014, the energy-friendly Gov. Rick Scott said FPL could move ahead with the project, but local governments . This year, FPL and the City of Miami settled their suit, and the company agreed to bury five miles of lines as long as the city dropped the rest of its complaints. The settlement meant a different, larger stretch of lines would remain above-ground for the next 40 years.\n\nBigger picture, FPL has also resisted solutions that would cut down on its carbon footprint in a state disproportionately affected by sea-level-rise- and climate-change-fueled monster storms.\n\nInstead of funneling money toward those extremely basic fixes, FPL has instead forced the public to pay for massive fossil-fuel and nuclear-energy plant upgrades. The company hiked rates by more than $811 million last year to build a natural-gas power plant and is urging state regulators to hand the company a blank check to build two new nuclear reactors at Turkey Point. Those upgrades don't really help when power lines are blown to shreds, and both plants will end up spewing carbon pollution into the air. Hurricane Irma marks yet another moment to question whether Florida's four regulated, private power monopolies make any sense in a world threatened by climate change.\n\nAccording to a March 2016 news release announcing a rate hike, FPL has apparently been studying the damage major storms such as Wilma and Hurricane Sandy caused to various electric grids:\n\nBut residents are now still asking why, if FPL had a decade to prepare for Irma, most of Miami's power grid went dead so quickly in Cat 1 conditions after 12 years of so-called resiliency efforts.\n\nThis past Tuesday, a New Times reporter toured the Little River Mobile Home Park on NW 79th Street in Miami. Peter Jean, a jovial resident who grew up in Haiti, pointed at a busted-up jumble of power lines and said that in the early hours of Sunday morning, the lines snapped and sparked a small fire in the trailer park.\n\n\"Some of us tried to call FPL,\" Jean said. \"Nobody came. Even now, no one has come.\"\n\nCorrection: After publication, this story was edited to make clear that FPL lobbying did not lead to rules governing of solar panels after a hurricane. Furthermore, the story now states regulations for solar-panel use in a power outage reflect national guidelines. This story also incorrectly stated that state law mandates solar customers tie their panels to the electric grid.",

      "text": "With Texas still reeling from Hurricane Harvey and another storm barreling toward Florida, the Federal Emergency Management Agency is expected to run out of money by Friday, according to a Senate aide, putting pressure on Congress to provide more funding this week.\n\nAs of 10 a.m. Tuesday morning, FEMAs Disaster Relief Fund, which pays for the agencys disaster response and recovery activity, had just $1.01 billion on hand. And of that, just $541 million was \"immediately available\" for response and recovery efforts related to Hurricane Harvey, according to a spokeswoman for FEMA who asked not to be identified by name.\n\nThe $1.01 billion in the fund Tuesday morning is less than half of the $2.14 billion that was there at 9 a.m. last Thursday morning -- a spend rate of $9.3 million every hour, or about $155,000 a minute.\n\nThe agency would be out of funds just as Irma, a category 5 hurricane, might start thrashing the coast of Florida.\n\n\"If its down to $1 billion or less, then I would say theres a great concern,\" said Elizabeth Zimmerman, who until January was FEMAs associate administrator for the office of response and recovery. \"Congress needs to take action very quickly.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trumps administration has asked Congress for an injection of almost $8 billion in additional funds.\n\nThe House is voting Wednesday on funding for Harvey. The Senate, which is expected to act this week as well, is considering whether to add a suspension of the federal debt limit to the measure. The legislation would then go back to the House.\n\nIn the meantime, FEMA has restricted spending to what it calls \"immediate needs\" -- what it calls \"lifesaving, life-sustaining response efforts\" for Harvey and Irma. Zimmerman said the agency can also start pulling money from other projects.\n\nBut without more money, Zimmerman said, the agency will be hard-pressed to deal with whats coming. \"Were not even at peak hurricane season,\" she said.\n\nIrma comes after Hurricane Harvey, which smashed ashore in Texas Aug. 25 causing widespread damage, power outages and flooding and taking almost a fifth of U.S. oil refining capacity offline.",

      "title": "$700B unpaid mortgage balances in Harvey and Irma disaster areas", 
      "text": "Even as the damage from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma is still being tallied, a preliminary assessment released last week by Black Knight Financial Services estimated that as many as 300,000 borrowers in the vicinity of Houston could become delinquent on their loans and 160,000 could become seriously delinquent, or more than 90 days past due.\n\nThat number is roughly four times the original prediction because new disaster zones were designated and more homes flooded when officials released water from reservoirs to protect dams, according to CNBCs Diana Olick. In total, the number of mortgaged properties in Texas disaster zones is 1.18 million, with Black Knight adding that Houston disaster zones contain twice as many mortgaged properties than Katrina zones, with four times the unpaid principal balance.\n\nPutting the Harvey damange in context, after Hurricane Katrina mortgage delinquencies in Louisiana and Mississippi disaster areas spiked by 25%. The same could happen in Houston, as borrowers without flood insurance weigh their options and decide to walk away from the property. While they will get some federal relief, if rebuilding would cost more than the principal in their homes, they could decide to walk away according to Olick.\n\nAccording to a preliminary analysis by Black Knight released today, Florida FEMA-designated disaster areas related to Hurricane Irma include a whopping 3.1 million mortgaged properties.  As Black Knights EVP Ben Graboske explained, both the number of mortgages and the unpaid principal balances of those mortgages in FEMA-designated Irma disaster areas are significantly larger than in the areas impacted recently by Hurricane Harvey.\n\nQuantifying the damage, Black Knight calculates that Irma-related disaster areas contain nearly three times as many mortgaged properties as those connected to Hurricane Harvey, and nearly seven times as many as those connected to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. In dollar terms, this means that there is some $517 billion in unpaid principal balances in Irma-related disaster areas, nearly three times the amount as in those related to Harvey and more than 11 times of those connected to Katrina.\n\nWhile the total extent of the damage from Hurricane Irma is still being determined, it is clear that the size and scope of the disaster is immense, said Graboske.\n\nIndeed, in terms of the number of mortgaged properties and their associated unpaid principal balances, Irma significantly outpaces even the number of borrowers impacted by Hurricane Harvey. With FEMA expanding the number of Irma-related designated disaster areas late Wednesday, Sept. 13, to a total of 37 Florida counties, more than 90 percent of all mortgaged properties in the state now fall into such areas. More than 3.1 million properties are now included in FEMA-designated Irma disaster areas, representing approximately $517 billion in unpaid principal balances. In comparison, Harvey-related disaster areas held 1.18 million properties  more than twice as many as with Hurricane Katrina in 2005  with a combined unpaid principal balance of $179 billion. Irma-related disaster areas now contain nearly seven times as many mortgaged properties as those connected to Katrina, with more than 11 times the principal balances.\n\nCombining the preliminary estimates for both Harvey and Irma suggests that over 3.3 million total mortgaged properties are located in Irma and Harvey-related FEMA Disaster zones, while the dollar amount of total unpaid mortgage balances in these two zones is massive: between Irmas $517 billion and Harveys $179 billion, the total potential damage could impact as much as a $696 billion in notional mortgage values, which banks could be on the hook for if current occupiers decide to simply walk away.\n\nBased on back of the envelope analyses by Black Knight, an extrapolation of the Katrina damage would suggest that Florida could suffer as much as 750,000 mortgage delinquencies as a result of Hurricane Irma.\n\nTo be sure, there are mitigating circumstances: Florida borrowers likely have more insurance and less exposure to loss, but for those homes with the most damage, homeowners will be making the same calculation as those that suffered devastating flooding after Harvey. Another issue in Florida according to Olick is that even a decade later, the housing market is still recovering from the foreclosure crisis. Five percent of Florida borrowers still owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth, and an additional 5 percent have very little equity in their homes. Home prices in Fort Myers, which saw considerable flooding from Irma, are still 29 percent below what they were during the housing boom.\n\nStill, in order to avoid a surge in foreclosures, lenders are more likely to offer borrowers, even seriously delinquent borrowers, options to catch up, although the biggest risk to lenders will be in Houston, where some homeowners may see no good reason to stay.\n\nThere was some silver lining: As Irma forged its path of destruction through the Caribbean, one relatively positive development was that Puerto Rico escaped the direct hit many had predicted. From a mortgage performance perspective, this was particularly good news, as delinquencies, there were already quite high leading up to the storm. At more than 10 percent, Puerto Ricos delinquency rate is nearly three times that of the U.S. average, as is its 5.8 percent serious delinquency rate. In contrast, the disaster areas declared in Florida have starting delinquency rates below the national average, providing more than a glimmer of optimism as we move forward.\n\nUnfortunately, Hurricane Maria, now a Category 3, is expected to hit Puerto Rico sometime on Wednesday, adding to the damage already suffered from Irma, and potentially sending the already bankrupt territory reeling even deeper into the financial hole.",

      "text": "This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, as we continue to look at Puerto Ricos recovery from Hurricanes Maria and Irma, one month since Maria made landfall. This comes as residents desperate for drinking water have begun pumping water from the Dorado Groundwater Contamination Site, a hazardous waste Superfund site. The EPA warns the water contains chemicals that cause liver damage and an increased risk of cancer.\n\nOur next guest, Rosa Clemente, is just back from Puerto Rico, where she joined other independent journalists in documenting conditions for a project called PR on the Map. This is a clip from a video she recorded at the Dorado Superfund site, where she met a woman filling up her water tank.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ: That was Rosa Clemente speaking with a woman filling up her water tank at the Dorado Superfund site in Puerto Rico. And now Rosa joins us in our studio. She was the 2008 vice-presidential nominee for the Green Party, is now a doctoral candidate at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.\n\nWelcome back to Democracy Now! Youve been in Puerto Rico now for the past 13 days. Tell us what you saw on the ground.\n\nROSA CLEMENTE: Yeah, well, PR on the Map is an intergenerational, unfiltered group that I put together in less than 10 days, because I knew no one could tell the stories like we could tell.\n\nSo, look, the people of Puerto Rico are dying. They want a Puerto Rico without Puerto Ricans. So, from contaminated water to mothers who are not lactating, to babies having to eat mashed bananas because baby food cannot be found, to people getting on ice lines from 3 a.m. in the morning to 1 p.m. waiting for two bags of ice, this is massive violations of human rights. This is a colonial problem that began 119 years ago. And in my opinion, from what weve seen, the government has collapsed in Puerto Rico.\n\nAnd we were able to get to places that the military said they couldnt get to, in a Kia and a Hyundai Accent, all the way to Aguadilla, Moca, Utuado. People have not even seen one-tenth of what is happening in all these places.\n\nROSA CLEMENTE: Well, thats the Superfund site in Dorado. That was a little easier to get to. But the fact that we got to Utuado, to theIm sorry, Amy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: But I mean just the site, that theyre drinking from it.\n\nROSA CLEMENTE: Oh, yeah. They dontthe water looks clean, but the hoses that they pick up are in the ground. Its completely black. We had peoplea veteran pull up to us and said, Mira, pull up your socks. You know, its chemicals. He said hes a veteran of Afghanistan and Iraq, and he has never seen the level of incompetence coming from the top all the way through the municipalities.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ: I think thats an important point, because during Katrina, there was a lot of criticism of the local government\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ: the mayor, [Nagin], and the governor. But in Puerto Rico, really, this government has totally failed the local governmentthe newly elected governorto deal with the crisis.\n\nROSA CLEMENTE: Well, thattwo days ago, he was at a concert in Miami with Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony, raising money for his wifes fund. He also recently made an agreement with a private electrical company based in Montana, that has no record of how to build a power grid. Ninety percent of the island, Juan, is still without electricity. And much of what we see, too, is San Juan, who relatively is doing well.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Lets turn to San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, her message to the Puerto Rican diaspora, the many Puerto Ricans living here in New York, in Florida, across the United States.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ: That was the San Juan mayor, Carmen Yulin Cruz, in an interview with our guest, Rosa Clemente, for the project PR on the Map. Rosa, if you could talk about that? Because Carmen Yulin Cruz has been a target of President Trump for daring to question the relief effort of the federal government.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ: Could you talk about her role?\n\nROSA CLEMENTE: Yeah. First, lets just say that 45 is a megalomaniac white supremacist, and thats what were dealing with, plain and simple. But Carmen Yulin Cruz has beenhas become de facto the leader of Puerto Rico. Shes also the voice for the mayors that, to this day, have not received walkie-talkies, People might not understand, theres 78 municipalities in Puerto Rico. Thats a political problem. Theres 77 mayors, and Mayor Cruz has become kind of the leader of Puerto Rico. She gave us an audio interview the day before, while she was getting a respiratory breathing thing, because shes so overworked. And that next day, she gave us over an hour, and that exclusive video will drop on Friday. But there have been a little bit of critiques from, I think, people in San Juan who are saying shes going to other places. But when we have more an extended conversation, we go, Well, maybe because the mayors are completely isolated. There is no FEMA.\n\nWhen we were in Utuado, we went to the FEMA location. They werent trying to tell us where it was. Theres no signage of how to get there. A national guard, off the record, said, Go here, go here. We got there. There were over 40,000 meals that had not been distributed to the people in Utuado, but there was a complete military occupation of that town. And people said, Why? We asked, Why do you think? They said, Theres copper. Theres potential uranium in these mines. And they want to take this city, you know, this part of the island, for that.\n\nROSA CLEMENTE: We were at a press conference, and they were incensed. It was all types of different nurses.\n\nROSA CLEMENTE: One of the many nurses that were there. One of the things that theyre saying is that theyre actually feeling afearing a cholera outbreak, the leptospirosis from all the rats, dead animals, thats in the water. As well, they let us know that the U.S.S. Comfort, that is there, that can hold 3,000 patients\n\nROSA CLEMENTE: The ship, the hospital, at the present moment, has 16 people in it. And from personal experience, my aunt was in a hospital in Bayamon. They let me in with a hazmat suit to see her for 10 minutes. And the nurse said, Unless youre dying, even if you have an infection that can kill you, we cannot have surgery, because we dont have water.

      "title": "Rebuilding Puerto Rico after the hurricane: All Wall Street cares about is their money", 
      "text": "Trumps recent visit to Puerto Rico illustrated an arrogant attitude toward a dire situation. At least 30 percent of Puerto Ricans have no electricity, and electric power is not likely to return until the end of October. The presidents threats to cut off aid expose the real intentions of the U.S. ruling class.\n\nPrior to the hurricanes a U.S. puppet regime called the fiscal control board was put in place, and it continues to funnel big money to Wall Street. Former Ukrainian finance minister and U.S. State Department hack Natalie Jaresko was hand picked for her ability to implement a massive austerity program for the island. Her belief is that Puerto Ricans created the problem, and the only solution is to deepen the islands dependency on creditors. The same creditors and banks that have kept Puerto Rico underdeveloped for generations now propose to solve the problem\n\nSocialist Action reporter Ernie Gotta connected with Mikael Rosa of the Movimiento Independentista Nacional Hostosiano to see what the political situation is like following the devastating hurricanes. Mikael will speak in New Britain, Conn., on Nov. 4 during the 2nd annual The Solution is Socialism conference. Go to Facebook.com/SocialistActionCT for more details.\n\nSocialist Action: What is the situation on the ground? Can you explain how relief efforts are progressing?\n\nMikael Rosa: Is very important to make a distinction between what is happening in the metropolitan area of San Juan, and the rest of the island. The reality is that there are areas that the local and imperial authorities have not even looked at.  We still have people without basic supplies like water and food. People have lost their entire houses, and others are facing the challenge of acquiring medicines and treatment for serious diseases like diabetes and cancer. While this happens, our hospitals are having energy problems, and their generators are not working.\n\nSA: FEMA had this to say about the crisis in Puerto Rico: Not our job to deliver water and food. President Trump echoed that sentiment when he made a statement about pulling back federal relief. What is your response to the U.S. government?\n\nMR: Those statements are just part of their public policy as colonizers. Colonies are a business, and all they care about is profit. If this situation related to Hurricane Maria endangers their interests, they prefer to let the Puerto Rican population suffer, instead of providing the humanitarian aid required.\n\nSA: Trump took to Twitter and made the following remarks: Puerto Rico survived the hurricanes, now a financial crisis looms largely of their own making, says Sharyl Attkisson. A total lack of accountability, says the Governor. Electric and all infrastructure was disaster before hurricanes. In reality, it is not hard for one to imagine that the legacy of colonialism alongside the forced placement of the fiscal control board has had a major impact. Can you explain the real root causes of the disastrous infrastructure and financial crisis?\n\nMR: The economy of a colony functions for the colonizers interests. For decades, U.S. corporations have taken large amounts of profit from us, thanks to tax exemptions. We dont have the tools to create our own economic project, nor to protect our national production. Federal-imposed laws do not let us develop local industries. So, as time passed, the Puerto Rican economy was based on speculationand now we all know the consequences of that.  Actually, I think President Trump knows very well the roots from our crisis, since he was one of those who took advantage from the economic speculation here in Puerto Rico.\n\nSA: How does Wall Street view the situation? Do they stand to benefit? Is there a real possibility of developers and banks taking over large sections of land?\n\nMR: All Wall Street cares about is profit. I dont want it to sound like a dogma or a mantra, but it is proven that all they care about is their money. Before hurricane Maria it was extremely difficult to pay our debt, but now it is impossible to pay it. If they insist in making us pay an illegal debt, they will make even worse the humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico.\n\nSA: Can you explain role of the governor and local politicians in Puerto Rico in relation to the exploitation by the U.S.?\n\nMR: The best answer to this question is to take a quick look at the visit by President Trump to Puerto Rico. Our local politicians are allies of U.S. interests. They were smiling while Mr. Trump was making fun of our situation. They thought that the federal government would quickly solve our situation. Instead, what we are facing is humiliation, with the consent of our local politicians.\n\nSA: Please explain for our readers the meaning of the struggle for independence in the wake of the current crisis.\n\nMR: A basic requirement for the development of a country is the capacity to have open and free negotiations with the whole world. In this context, it is essential to receive aid and relief from every part of the world. Our political situation does not even let us have direct contact with other countries in order to move forward in our recuperations. The fact that we are not an independent country means that we wont be able to build a new country under our terms. Instead, the recuperations will be in function of U.S. interests. As a consequence, we will go back to the same problems and crisis.",

      "text": "More than six in 10 Americans say that Puerto Rico isn't getting the help they need and a majority says the federal government hasn't been doing enough and the response is too slow, according to a new poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nA broad 62% of respondents said most Puerto Ricans are not getting the help they need, while only one in three said that they are. The results were largely split along party lines, with 80% of Democrats, 61% of Independents and 38% of Republicans saying more help is needed.\n\nWith more than 80% of Puerto Ricans without electricity after Hurricane Maria, the island's recovery is expected to last years.\n\nBut on Thursday morning, President Donald Trump seemed to suggest a strategy at odds with what most Americans think is called for in Puerto Rico, tweeting that efforts to help the island need to be reconsidered, if not rolled back. \"We cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever,\" he tweeted.\n\nThis follows weeks in which Puerto Rico's recovery has been politicized, with Trump engaging in a public back-and-forth with the mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yulin Cruz, after the mayor criticizing the administration's response. Trump tweeted back that Yulin Cruz lacked leadership.\n\nMeanwhile, a slim majority of Americans, 52%, said they do not think the federal government is doing enough to restore electricity and access to food and water, the poll found. The same number, 52%, said that the federal government's response has been too slow, highlighting similar partisan splits.\n\nMore people also believe problems restoring basic services are more the fault of the federal government than the local Puerto Rican government. A plurality, 44%, said most of the blame for the problems with Puerto Rico's recovery lies with the federal government, but 32% said it falls on the disorganization of the local government.\n\nAmericans are evenly divided on whether race and poverty are driving the slow response. Forty-six percent said things would be moving faster if Puerto Rico were a wealthier place with fewer Hispanic people. Forty-four percent said poverty and ethnicity have not affected the recovery. The responses to these questions were also largely split along party lines.\n\nThis Kaiser Family Foundation poll was conducted from Oct. 4-8 among 1,008 adults. The margin of sampling error is +/-4% pts. The poll followed a criticized event on October 4 in which Trump seemed to use Puerto Rico's death toll as a talking point for the island's recovery success. The total number who have died from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico is still unknown, but the total has increased several times since the event.",

      "title": "FEMA removes statistics about water and electricity in Puerto Rico from its website - The Boston Globe", 
      "text": "As of Wednesday, half of Puerto Ricans had access to drinking water and 5 percent of the island had electricity, according to statistics published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on its Web page documenting the federal response to Hurricane Maria.\n\nBy Thursday morning, both of those key metrics were no longer on the Web page.\n\nFEMA spokesman William Booher noted that both measures are still being reported on a website maintained by the office of Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Rossello, www.status.pr. According to that website, which is in Spanish, 9.2 percent of the island now has power and 54.2 percent of residents have access to drinking water. Booher said that these measures are also shared in news conferences and media calls that happen twice a day, but he didnt elaborate on why they are no longer on the main FEMA page.\n\nOur mission is to support the governor and his response priorities through the unified command structure to help Puerto Ricans recover and return to routines. Information on the stats you are specifically looking for are readily available on the website maintained by the governors office, Booher said.\n\nThe statistics on the FEMA page, as of Thursday afternoon, include these: There are now 14,000 federal workers on the ground in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, up from 12,300 earlier in the week. All airports, federally maintained ports and post offices are open. More than 30 miles of roadway have been cleared, up from about 20 miles earlier in the week. About 65 percent of grocery stores have reopened, along with nearly all hospitals and dialysis centers. And 64 percent of wastewater treatment plants are working on generator power.\n\nThose statistics illustrate President Donald Trumps assertions that the island is quickly making tremendous strides toward full recovery and that the media have exaggerated the conditions on the ground. He has noted that despite the force of the storms that hit Puerto Rico, the death toll is not as high as it was after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when about 1,800 people were killed. Officials have said that it could be months before power and water are fully restored to the island, especially in rural, isolated areas.\n\nTrump, who visited Puerto Rico on Tuesday, has repeatedly noted that the infrastructure of the financially struggling island was already weak before the hurricane hit. In a series of tweets Sept. 25, Trump wrote that Puerto Rico was already suffering from broken infrastructure & massive debt and had an old electrical grid, which was in terrible shape. During his visit Tuesday, Trump told reporters that its difficult to fix the power grid because it was devastated before the hurricanes even hit, and that federal workers have been bringing dozens of generators to the island to power hospitals, government buildings, shelters and other key locations.",

      "text": "Its been more than five weeks since hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico, and life in the island is still filled with uncertainty: How many people died? When will power come back? How many people will end up leaving for good?\n\nIn this series, Quartz is examining questions Puerto Ricans are navigating. Heres the first installment, on Leptospirosis, a bacterial disease that can be deadly if left untreated.\n\nSan Juan, Puerto RicoConditions are ripe for disease in Puerto Rico. The storm and subsequent rains left pools of standing water that have become breeding ground for mosquitoes. People are living many to a house or shelter, as they concentrate near sources of power and running water. Those without it resorted to potentially contaminated streams and rivers to wash their clothes and bathe. The piles of debris, which still line many streets, are a haven for vermin.\n\nTheres been outbreaks of gastroenteritis and conjunctivitis. Theres also more than 70 suspected cases of Leptospirosis, a disease transmitted by the urine of infected animals, including mice and dogs.\n\nIts still unclear whether Leptospirosis is spreading or not. Samples from the suspected cases have been sent to the US for testing. The tests are fairly complicated, says Henry Walke, chief of the bacterial special pathogens branch the USs Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC.) It takes about four days to conclude them, he adds. The first 10 cases were reported the second week of October; a week later, they had gone up to 73 suspected cases. However, so far officials say they have only obtained confirmed results for four of those cases: two patients died; the other two are hospitalized.\n\nWalke, and Puerto Ricos state epidemiologist, Carmen Deseda, say they are waiting for the rest of the test results to evaluate whether theres been an outbreak or not. Other illnesses, they point out, including dengue and the flu have the same symptoms, such as fever. Puerto Ricans should be cautious about those diseases as well, they add.\n\nIn the meantime, they say, they are treating all patients with Leptospirosis symptoms with antibiotics. They are also spreading the word about contamination risks, asking people to avoid walking barefoot and distributing chlorine tablets to disinfect water. Trucks, too, have been distributing water to people with no access to it.\n\nWere deploying all these strategies, said Deseda. Time will tell how efficient we were in spreading that message.\n\nShe and Walke expect the threat of disease to go down as power and water services are restored. When that will be is yet another unknown.",

Given the emergency situation in Puerto Rico, I will be traveling there to visit with San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz and other officials to determine the best way forward to deal with the devastation the island is experiencing,\" Sanders said in a statement.\n\n\"The U.S. Congress cannot turn its back on the millions of people in Puerto Rico who, four weeks after the hurricane, are still without electricity, food and running water,\" he continued.\n\nThe announcement comes after the Women's Convention faced fierce backlash for choosing Sanders to headline the opening day of the conference.\n\nWe were grateful that Senator Sanders had accepted our invitation to continue his longstanding record of support and allyship for women leaders. It is unfortunate that Senator Sanders will no longer be able to join us at the Womens Convention next week, but the humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico - which is being exacerbated by the inaction of our federal government - is a critical matter,\" the Women's March said in a statement to The Hill.\n\n\"We understand his leadership is needed in Puerto Rico and, as always, we deeply appreciate his commitment to communities in need. We look forward to working with him on key issues including Medicare for All, which will continue to be an important topic of our Convention program.\n\nVarious women's groups, as well as female media figures such as actress Debra Messing and MSNBC host Joy Reid questioned the decision to have Sanders deliver the convention's opening speech.\n\n\"This announcement sends the wrong message to women everywhere,\" EMILY's List President Stephanie Schriock said in a statement earlier this month, while the Center for American Progresss Neera Tanden called it pretty amazing and said she was unfollowing the organization.\n\nThe event is being organized by the Women's March, which spearheaded massive protests in Washington and cities across the country the day after President Trump's inauguration.\n\nThe convention is aimed at bringing together politicians and activists for \"workshops, strategy sessions, [and] inspiring forums\" as they gear up for the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nSen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) will deliver the opening remarks at the convention in Detroit.\n\nRep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) will also speak at the event.",

      "text": "Owners of a San Juan studio left without power in the wake of Hurricane Maria are urging students to come back to class, even if it means dancing in the dark.\n\nParents came to us to say thank you because, even if they took a road that had trees in the middle of it, they brought their kids because the kids need it, they need to start living again the way they were, said Laura Valentin-Lopez, a former Principal ballerina who owns San Juans Centro Danza with husband Osmay Molina.\n\nAfter the deadly storm, Molina and Valentin-Lopez, who is nine months pregnant, quickly got to work removing water that had flooded half the studios and repairing the crumbled doorway and ceiling of the school theyd just opened in August.\n\nAs we walked in, we said, lets go, take water out, lets clean, Valentin-Lopez, 38, said. There are a lot of people that have lost everything, we wanted to work with what we had.\n\nTen days later, they reopened, ready for any students who could reach them.\n\nDancers run choreography illuminated by flashlights, candles and even cellphone lights, sometimes without music because there arent enough batteries to power the schools two radios.\n\nClasses start at 5 p.m. since road conditions and heavy traffic make it difficult for students to arrive any earlier. Some who live 30 minutes away can take over two hours to make it to the studio, Valentin-Lopez said.\n\nDancing in the dark isnt easy, students stumble, are unable to practice turns without a focus point and its more difficult for teachers to give instructions. Without power, classes cant use fans, even on hot days, and wood floors in the studios have become uneven due to flooding.\n\nBut Valentin-Lopez believes continuing to offer classes is important for her students well being.\n\nWe were thinking of the benefits that dance brings to the spirit, she said. All of us in Puerto Rico are living outside of our routines and this keeps a discipline of what we love.\n\nGod has a purpose with everything, she added. Maybe its time to rethink help. If we have to teach in the darkness, teach in the darkness, lets light the candles.",

      "title": "After Maria, Jose Andres and his team have prepared more hot meals in Puerto Rico than the Red Cross", 
      "text": "This story has been updated.\n\nA week ago, President Trump issued a warning on Twitter: He could not keep the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the military and other first responders in Puerto Rico forever, he wrote. His tweet was quickly viewed by some as a threat that the government might abandon its own territory before the island could recover from the devastating blow delivered by Hurricane Maria in mid-September.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, chef and restaurateur Jose Andres said his nonprofit, World Central Kitchen, and the hundreds who have volunteered to help it, would keep feeding Puerto Ricans until the locals could again take care of themselves, which could take awhile. According to FEMA, only 14 percent of the island has electricity, and many areas still have no drinking water or access to fresh food.\n\nWhen we establish contact with a community, we maintain that contact, Andres said during a phone interview from San Juan. When we go to a place, we take care of that place until we feel it has the right conditions to sustain itself. Thats what a relief organization should be.\n\nAndres landed in Puerto Rico on Sept. 25 and immediately started working with chef Jose Enrique, whose eponymous San Juan restaurant was already preparing batches of sancocho  a Puerto Rican beef stew  for hungry residents. In their first couple of days together, the chefs produced enough food to feed 1,000 or 2,000 people. Within a week of Andress appearance on the island, their numbers skyrocketed to 25,000 meals per day, now including sandwiches and paella.\n\n[Jose Andres, a naturalized U.S. citizen, has become the face of American disaster relief]\n\nNearly a month after Maria, Andres, World Central Kitchen and volunteers have reached a milestone in their #chefsforpuertorico campaign: As of Tuesday, they had prepared and delivered one million hot meals to residents. As a point of comparison, the American Red Cross has delivered 150,000 MREs (or meals ready to eat), 302,000 meal boxes, and 1.4 million pounds of canned goods, rice, beans, crackers, fruit, vegetables and other shelf-stable foods, said Elizabeth Penniman, vice president of communications for the organization. She estimated that those supplies equate to 1.6 million meals served in Puerto Rico after hurricanes Irma and Maria.\n\nTo be clear, Penniman wrote in an email Wednesday, the primary mission for the American Red Cross in Puerto Rico is to provide emergency supplies and to support reunification for those missing loved ones.\n\nFEMA has provided more than 14 million meals and 11 million liters of water in all 78 municipalities in Puerto Rico, said spokesman Dan Stoneking. That number includes meals provided by state, local and volunteer organizations, such as World Central Kitchen, which FEMA has helped fund. Many of FEMAs meals are military and civilian MREs, or meals ready to eat, which do not include hot food.\n\nHow Andres and crew have pulled off this feat is a story thats difficult to piece together on a cellphone call to Puerto Rico, where service remains spotty and the chef remains too swamped to walk a reporter through all the complex logistics of feeding an island with little gas, electricity or transportation. The chef said it started with Enriques restaurant and has now expanded to 15 kitchens, including the Coliseo de Puerto Rico in San Juan, where the majority of the meals are prepared. Between 450 and 500 volunteers are involved daily.\n\nIn fact, after Andres navigated Houstons flooded streets to help feed the city following Hurricane Harvey, he learned an important lesson about relief operations: You need a facility with a large-capacity kitchen to prepare meals on a massive scale; otherwise youll never quiet a citys hunger pains following a disaster. In Houston, Andres worked at the downtown convention center. But in Puerto Rico, he initially couldnt get access to the coliseum.\n\nFirst, I wanted to come to the coliseo, where I am right now, because I was looking for the biggest kitchen, and they told me, No way, Jose,' Andres recalled, now laughing at the story. A week later, however, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello and first lady Beatriz Areizaga helped the chef secure access to the coliseum, where cooks now prepare more than 60,000 meals a day.\n\n[For one night, Washington gets a six-star Michelin restaurant]\n\nAssistance has come from a variety of sources, Andres said. Donors, large and small, have contributed millions of dollars to World Central Kitchen. Goya Foods loaned WCK its helicopter to fly food into remote regions in the mountains. (The helicopter also helped crews locate a working kitchen, which is now one of the 15 spots for meal preparation.) Even Homeland Security has assisted with food distribution, Andres said, after the agency helped the chef locate a missing person.\n\nI became friends with them, he said of Homeland Security personnel. We saw that they were going to the very hard-hit areas and that they were going with their cars halfway empty. They said we could bring food, so we began giving them food. They began taking thousands of sandwiches.\n\nFEMA initially provided money to World Central Kitchen to prepare 20,000 meals. But when the agency tried to negotiate a second contract to prepare another 20,000 meals, Andres balked. The chef wanted money for 120,000 meals, which exceeded FEMAs authority to grant without putting the contract out to bid, an agency spokesman said. Regardless, FEMA said it was still looking at another contract with WCK to fund the organizations meals program.\n\nAndres then expressed his frustration about government bureaucracy to a Time magazine reporter.\n\nFEMA used me as a puppet to show that they were doing something, Andres told the magazine about the original contract.\n\nSeveral days later, Andres dialed down his rhetoric, if not his desire to see more from his government. The native Spaniard became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2013.\n\nYou know me, nobody holds me back. But at the same time, you have to be strategic, Andres said. He understands that FEMA employees have to abide by the rules and the thresholds established by people higher up in the agency. But he would still like to see more flexibility from the agency, particular during times of crisis.\n\nBureaucracy needs to give them the tools to move quick and fast to take care of people, he said. If bureaucracy doesnt allow them to move quick and fast, its a problem.\n\nAndres is not just talking the talk, either. Since he arrived in Puerto Rico, he has put much of his life on hold in Washington, where he oversees ThinkFoodGroup, a company with more than a dozen restaurants, a catering division and a food truck. Andres was in Puerto Rico, in fact, when he heard the news that Minibar, the chefs gastronomic funhouse in Penn Quarter, maintained its two Michelin stars.\n\nIn the three-plus weeks since Maria pummeled the island, Andres has been home only three or four days, he said. He returned once after becoming dehydrated.\n\nThe reality here is very hard to escape. My question is, if we dont do it, whos going to do it? Andres said about feeding Puerto Ricans. Fresh food is hard to come by . . . Sometimes the only fresh food people are eating is fruit we are bringing. The only hot meal they are eating is the lukewarm meal we are bringing.\n\n[Komi, Metier join the Michelin star ranks, but no D.C. restaurants earn a coveted third star]\n\nAndres hopes that World Central Kitchen is demonstrating what kind of results a nonprofit with a private sector mentality can achieve. He suspects that, in years to come, others will be examining our successes and failures and how we did it.\n\nHow we were able to go from 100 meals to a million meals, he added. The secret, Andres noted, was the chef community, the many volunteers who picked up a knife and got to it. A chefs disposition, Andres said, is to know how to adapt to crisis.\n\nWe are survivors, he said. We never wanted to be here for so long . . . But circumstances invited us to be part of it.\n\nThen Andres remembered a favorite quote from literature, taken from a John Steinbeck novel: Where theres a fight so hungry people can eat, I will be there, he said.\n\nAndres remembered the quote almost verbatim. Its a line from Tom Joad, the central character in Steinbecks Depression-era novel, The Grapes of Wrath. Joad is the one who experiences a major transformation over the course of the story. He, as CliffsNotes reminds us, undergoes a moral journey from self to community, from I to we.\n\nJose Andres is in Houston, ready to cook: If I can feed one person, Im happy.\n\nThe best margherita pizzas in the D.C. area, ranked",

      "title": "2 Strangers, A 6-Page List And A Plan Hatched To Help Puerto Rico", 
      "text": "2 Strangers, A 6-Page List And A Plan Hatched To Help Puerto Rico\n\nJose Ortiz and Ethan Leder had never met, but they quickly came up with an unconventional plan to help Puerto Rico.\n\nOrtiz and Leder's personalities are similar: both are high energy, do-er types. \"It's all about doing stuff\" says Leder. \"Not just talk,\" adds Ortiz.\n\nWhen Hurricane Maria hit, Ortiz, a 47-year-old flooring business owner, says his \"brain was completely obsessed with it.\" He was born in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico and was 11 when his family moved to the Washington, D.C. area. \"I was just trying to get in touch with anyone in Puerto Rico to offer help.\"\n\nLeder, meanwhile, has no connection to the island. But he followed the news of the hurricane, especially that \"there was and there is a massive shortage of supplies and medicines\" and a logjam on supplies in general. Leder is a health care business entrepreneur in Bethesda, Maryland; he's the founder and CEO of \"Precision for Medicine Group,\" a company that develops targeted medicines. He describes himself as pragmatic.\n\nTogether, Ortiz and Leder  without the help of any major agency or aid organization  managed to charter a plane to the island filled with donated medical supplies and get people with acute medical needs out of the island for treatment in the continental U.S.\n\nPuerto Ricans living on the U.S. mainland are desperately trying to figure out how to best help their relatives back home. The island's population is 3.4 million and there are even more  about 5 million  Puerto Ricans living elsewhere in the United States. Since Hurricane Maria hit many organizations like Unidos for Puerto Rico, AmeriCares and the Red Cross are organizing relief efforts, but many Puerto Ricans and other Americans are finding more direct ways to send help to the island.\n\nThe entire island's power was knocked out by the storm and nearly a month after the hurricane hit only 15 percent of people have power and fewer than 60 percent have mobile phone service now though the signal isn't too reliable. The shortage of electricity is creating profound problems in Puerto Rico  from no access to cash at ATMs to shortages of ice and lack of internet, but hospitals are the most challenged on the island.\n\n\"I was just thinking 'why are they not able to get ships, massive floating hospitals quickly in to help'\" to Puerto Rico, Leder says. As all those thoughts were running through his head, he says \"I'm getting frustrated ... I got to do something, this is crazy.\"\n\nLeder called the head of a large relief organization  he didn't want to name which one  to seek out guidance on how to help and left a message. Then he called the only Puerto Rican he knows, the parent of one of his son's classmates. That parent connected Leder to Ortiz on a phone call that same night  eight days after Maria hit the island. \"We just started really focusing on what we could do that needed to be done,\" says Leder. \"We talked and texted about 50 times a day since.\"\n\nThe two complement each other. Ortiz is a native Spanish-speaker and knows the island's culture and geography. He's focused and determined. Leder has never been to the island  he's trained as a lawyer and has connections in medical circles.\n\n\"I sent out an email to all my contacts and I said, 'look guys, I'll fly to Puerto Rico next week. Here's a list of what's needed.'\" Lo and behold, says Leder, donations starting to pour in  anything from insulin, diabetes test strips, antibiotics, test drips, anesthesia, pepto bismol, ensure, antibiotics, steroids, wound kits and gauze; they also secured two generators, repellent and purifying water drops.\n\nLeder and Ortiz made their first trip earlier this month on October 3. Leder put the almost $75,000 cost of the charter flight on his credit card.\n\nOrtiz, a marathon runner with a piercing gaze and soft voice, describes his partner in this endeavor as an \"angel.\" After the two spoke on the phone for the first time, Ortiz knew things would work out, he says. \"The universe put us together at the perfect time.\"\n\nOne of Ortiz's assignments was to make contact with a city in need of hospital supplies. He focused on the western part of the island where he was born.\n\n\"I know that the west part of the island was not being taken care of\" he says, \"that was my mission.\"\n\nOrtiz worked his phone and was able to reach Wilbert Ruiz, the assistant mayor of the nearby city of Aguada. The message was left on the city's 911 for emergency services. Ruiz says, \"I couldn't believe it. Jose said they could deliver any medical supplies we needed.\" Ruiz wrote a six-page wish list, took a picture of it with his mobile phone and texted it to Ortiz.\n\nSo instead of flying to San Juan, they landed in Aguadilla, on the western side of the island and the second largest international airport in Puerto Rico.\n\nWilbert Ruiz took care of the logistics at his end and waited for the flight on the tarmac. \"Ethan and Jose's arrival felt like a movie,\" says Ruiz. Flights in and out of the island are still limited due to sheer mess left by hurricane Maria.\n\nThe storm destroyed the local hospital in Aguada and the city set up a makeshift clinic in the church. \"We have doctors working long hours with no pay, but for more than 10 days we didn't have medical supplies,\" says Ruiz, until Leder and Ortiz arrived. \"It was like being in a battlefield without guns.\"\n\n\"We are seeing between 50 and 75 patients a day\" says Ruiz. Conditions include skin infection, diabetic-related issues, mental health, dehydration and stomach poisoning, but doctors are also stitching wounds.\n\n\"Doctors are working hard to treat our patients here and to keep them out of hospitals,\" he says. Hospitals are overcrowded and lack air conditioning and patients' conditions can often worsen in those circumstances, Ruiz says.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency has delivered food and water to Aguada, but medical assistance has not reached the area, except for civilian help from the mainland, says Ruiz.\n\n\"I'm astounded by all the help\" says Ruiz, \"Ethan and Jose have a big heart. I don't know what we'd have done without them\" and others on the mainland who have sent help too, he says.\n\nRemember that message Ethan Leder left for the large NGO asking guidance on how to help the island after Maria hit? \"I received a response back the following week, after Jose and I had already done our first trip to the island,\" Leder recalls. Their response, he adds with a smile on his face, was one that is typical of what experts have been advising in the wake of the storm: \"the best thing to do is to fund organizations already on the ground because it's impossible to get in and out of Puerto Rico right now.\"\n\nLeder and Ortiz have also evacuated six people with medical needs to the mainland.\n\nElizabeth Rodriguez Santana, 63, is one of them. She suffers from acute kidney failure and she's been on dialysis for nine years. Hurricane Maria shut down the clinic in Mayaguez where she received treatment three times a week, four hours a pop. There were no doctors at the clinic even when it reopened, says Rodriguez Santana. She says she went days without treatment and then she got an appointment two months out. While she's desperately trying to find treatment on the island, her daughter in Jacksonville, Fla. was desperately working the phones trying to get Rodriguez Santana evacuated to the mainland.\n\nRodriguez Santana's daughter got her in touch with Jose Ortiz and Ethan Leder through friends and she was evacuated to Jacksonville on October 3.\n\n\"I wasn't going to make it on the island\" she says, her voice trembling with emotion.\n\nJose Ortiz and Ethan Leder say they are friends for life now. They have made two trips to the island and have delivered medical supplies to the cities of Isabela, Moca, Las Marias, Maricao and Aguada.\n\nThey say they are now standing by to go back to Puerto Rico \"as many times as there's a need. It's not that hard,\" says Leder.\n\nRodriguez Santana, who is now on the mainland, says she's eternally indebted to Jose and Ethan. \"That flight was the gift of life.\"",

      "text": "Three weeks after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, weve seen images of the destruction and heard stories about the lack of electricity and basic supplies like food and water in some areas.\n\nBut the main way we measure  and understand  the scope of any disaster is through the death toll.\n\nThe official count is now 48 deaths. But the news site Vox thought that number seemed off.\n\n\"We knew from reports on the ground, and investigative journalists who've also been looking into this, that this was very likely way too low of a number, said Eliza Barclay, an editor at Vox.\n\nSo they dug into the numbers, cross-checking with news reports, and found that the number of casualties resulting from the hurricane was probably much closer to 450.\n\nTwo members of Congress have now announced they will request an audit of the official death toll.\n\nHere are a few highlights from Voxs report:\n\n-At the time of the report, the official death toll was 43.\n\n -National and local news outlets reported an additional 36 deaths attributed to the hurricane.\n\n -NPR reported an additional 49 bodies with unidentified cause of death sent to a hospital morgue since the storm.\n\n -The Los Angeles Times reported 50 more deaths than normal in one region in the three days after the hurricane.\n\n -Puerto Rico's Center for Investigative Reporting found 69 hospital morgues were are at capacity.\n\n -According to El Vocero newspaper, 350 bodies are being stored at the Institute of Forensic Sciences awaiting autopsies, but its not clear how many of them were there before the hurricane.\n\nListen to The Worlds full interview with Voxs Eliza Barclay.\n\nMORE FROM GLOBAL POST AND PRI:\n\nThis article originally appeared on GlobalPost and PRI.org.

      "text": "The group Mutual Aid Disaster Relief (MADR) intends to raise at least $20,000 to deliver solar electricity and water filtration systems to Puerto Ricans hit by recent hurricanes. The community has roots in the Common Ground Health Clinic, a free clinic organized as Hurricane Katrina ravaged New Orleans They will be delivering these utility services through November.\n\nPeople who affiliate with MADR have delivered services to people caught in floods and hurricanes across the country. Their voluntary disaster response is guided by a set of principles including, solidarity, mutual aid, and autonomous direct action. They were involved in Occupy Sandy in New York and they sent medical teams to Haiti after a 2010 earthquake killed more than 100,000 people. They are connected to the Street Medic community that received praise in the media after the Unite The Right incident in Charlottesville.\n\nTheir Welcome Packet describes mutual aid as, Voluntary, reciprocal, participatory assistance among equals and being with, not for, disaster survivors. It is distinct from any commercial or government relationship between the people caught in catastrophe and the people delivering relief. The voluntary nature of the venture counteracts a tendency to commercialize disaster relief and aid. Their Vision mentions the intention to build healthy networks, as part of an awakened civil society that will restore hope following crisis, and turn the tide against disaster capitalism and climate chaos.\n\nThe rich and powerful seize upon the chaos following disasters to pass laws and deregulate industries. Naomi Klein defined this strategy in The Shock Doctrine and proved it with cases across the world. Post-Hurricane Katrina, public housing was closed and charter schools were opened. In Chile General Pinochets coup in the 80s came with a heavily deregulatory, and ultimately disastrous, policy package known as The Brick. These are both cases where the government pushed corporate interests while the public were distracted by catastrophes, a hurricane and a coup.\n\nTo enact a shock doctrine project you need to prepare a legislative program and a plan of enforcement. Then you wait patiently for an opportunity to enact it. MADR can also leverage a shock doctrine campaign. These volunteer disaster responders create their own new reality by showing up on the ground in communities experiencing natural disasters. MADRs world contrasts the new realities that oligarchs have sought to create. Where MADR seeks community empowerment the oligarchs seek profit. Where MADR fights for open access to resources the oligarchs push privatization. And where MADR relies on trained volunteers the oligarchs pay their experts well.\n\nThe vehicle of the message is the same but the goal of MADR is collective liberation, where the goal of the oligarch is personal gain and reputation. It works because in times of chaos people will be more open to change since they have less time to argue. You can enact your own projects with less interference. MADR does this for free, to help people. People in the aid and development industries do it because they can make an enterprise.\n\nThe Welcome Packet orients anybody interested in volunteering with them. It covers strategies and philosophy, group decision making, health and safety, and other considerations for living and working in a disaster zone which helps prepare them for Mutual Aid Disaster Relief activities and actions. The decentralized form of leadership that allows them to provide their Welcome Packet publicly plays well with their goal of creating stronger, more resilient communities because to build their reality over the existing commercial one, they need more people responding to the to more frequent disasters, and sharing their message of communal good.",

      "text": "Eric Adams of The Drive reports on entrepreneur Joel Ifill who arrived in Puerto Rico two weeks ago. Adams wrote that Ifils was to utilize in cargo logistics to see if they could help by air-dropping supplies to the most remote parts of the island, and to further developthrough first-hand experiencethe systems necessary to one day do that with drones.\n\nThe idea, of course, would seem like a no-brainer. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology is developing as fast as any other high-tech field, with the likes of leading the charge on the commercial side and the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines pushing just as hard on the military side. But at the momentthanks to FAA regulations that limit their use and testingthere are no unmanned systems that can help deliver critical supplies to areas in urgent need. They need to come via truck, or if the roads are out, helicopterassuming those are even available and there are landing sites. Either option is expensive, slow, manpower-intensive, and unreliable. But Ifills startup, DASH Systemshes CEOis working to develop a solution that uses precision-guided package delivery technology to quickly and economically distribute food, water, and other essentials with pinpoint accuracy. In his vision, emergency supplies would be loaded into small disposable containers that can be dropped out of manned aircraft and automatically steered to their destinations via control surfaces on the tail assembly. Each of these deviceshe hasnt released photos yet, but they look basically like squat little bombswould then float relatively slowly, thanks to their high-drag shape, to the surface and land lightly. They would be more accurate than parachute-deployed packages and able to guarantee landings within a 30-foot radiusso suitable for everything from mountainous terrain to urban areas. DASH isnt far enough along to test actual prototypes in Puerto Rico, so Ifill is using off-the-shelf parachute-deployed containers that he drops out of a small chartered cargo aircraft, a Cessna 208B operated by M&N Aviation in San Juan. He is, however, testing the companys mission planning software, which itself has helped improve the accuracy of the parachuted air-drops. Were able to reach the drop-zone with a bit more accuracy, Ifill says. Weve done two full flights so far, dropping 2,000 pounds of supplies each to three different locations from about 1,000 feet above the ground, with another scheduled for tomorrow. Theyre all inland mountain communities that are cut off from the supply sources, but they know were coming so theyre able to be ready for the drops.\"\n\nYahoo news reports on Monkey Island, an outcropping off the coast of Puerto Rico populated by rhesus macaques and their caretakers.\n\nAs Hurricane Maria barreled across the Caribbean one month ago, one of the first places to get caught in the eye of the storm was Cayo Santiago, a small island off Puerto Ricos southeastern coast that is populated only by monkeys. These arent just any monkeys, however. The 1,000 free-ranging rhesus macaques that make their homes on Cayo Santiago  also known as Monkey Island  inhabit the worlds oldest wild primate research center. Since 1938, when their ancestors were shipped there from Asia, scientists from around the globe have flocked to this tiny island in the Caribbean to study primate behavior, physiology and psychology. Researchers at Cayo Santiago recorded the sounds made by female macaques and concluded they , behavior that was thought to be exclusively human. Others observed females over long periods to detect subtle changes in skin color correlated with sexual receptivity . Now an international group of researchers are joining forces to save Monkey Island, and its human caretakers, in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, whose 150 mile-per-hour winds whipped across Cayo Santiago and the nearby community of Punta Santiago, home to many of the Caribbean Primate Research Centers employees and researchers. Though all the monkeys have been accounted for, the hurricane ravaged much of their home territory, as well as that of their human neighbors.\n\nHeres some great agencies with aid-workers hard at work on the ground in PR right now:\n\nYou can donate right to the Jose Andress Chefs group at\n\nHere is a we can get behind as well. To help those in the most need, celebrities and others started sending their private planes to pick up cancer patients, elderly, people needing medical care, etc.\n\nMore donation sites worthy of contributions.

      "title": "Puerto Ricans Ask: When Will the Lights Come Back On?", 
      "text": "In contrast with Texas after Hurricane Harvey and Florida after Irma, where thousands of repair workers rushed in to restring power lines, only a few hundred electrical workers from outside the island have arrived to help.\n\nIt was not until Saturday that the Puerto Rican government said it had the federal funding needed to bring in more workers. And until a week ago, the small Montana company hired to get the lights back on had only 165 workers on the ground; it now has about 300.\n\nIn comparison, 5,300 workers from outside the region converged on coastal Texas in the days after Hurricane Harvey to restore a power loss that was about a tenth the size, said Larry Jones, a spokesman for AEP Texas. Electricity was back on for almost everyone within two weeks.\n\nIn Florida, 18,000 outside workers went in after Hurricane Irma knocked out electricity to most of the state last month, according to FPL, Floridas largest power company.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, the brunt of the work has been left to the 900 members of local crews.\n\nIndustry experts said poor planning, a slow response by power officials and Puerto Ricos dire financial straits had led to a situation that would be unfathomable in the continental United States. Logistical challenges  like where to house the thousands of extra workers needed to get the lights back on  still have not been resolved.\n\nThirty days after the storm, I see very little progress, said Eduardo Bhatia, an opposition senator who in 2014 wrote an energy reform law. He added, I dont see the boots on the field doing the work, and that is a tragedy.\n\nAt the White House on Thursday, President Trump said the administration deserved a 10 for its response to the hurricanes that struck Puerto Rico and other parts of the United States.\n\nBut he conceded that the destruction of the power grid was one of Puerto Ricos biggest long-term challenges, despite the provision of massive numbers of generators to temporarily provide electricity to hospitals and other crucial facilities.\n\nYou cant really bring electric back until you rebuild the power plant, Mr. Trump said during an appearance with Gov. Ricardo A. Rossello of Puerto Rico. The federal government will help rebuild the power grid, he said, but the plant itself is going to take a while.\n\nIn Gurabo, just outside Caguas, Reynaldo De Hostos spends most of his time outside seeking relief from insufferable indoor heat. Ever since we lost electricity, we cant sleep, he said, standing inside his pitch-dark home. Every hour or so at night, he said, he and his family use the air-conditioning in the car for a brief respite.\n\nEven local utility employees are frustrated. We need trucks, we need poles, we need crews, we need lines, we need more people, said Javier Hernandez Sauri, a lineman who led a team of repair workers making their way up Mr. Rodriguezs street. Its going very slowly.\n\nHe added, Were rewiring mostly with materials that can be reused.\n\nThe Army Corps of Engineers, charged by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with restoring Puerto Ricos power, estimated that it needed at least 2,000 additional workers. So far, the Corps has brought only about 200 workers, and most of them were dedicated not to restoring power but to installing generators at crucial locations.\n\nAfter major storms, power companies typically rely on mutual aid agreements to get electricity restored. Outside companies send thousands of workers, and electric companies pay for the service with funds from FEMA.\n\nSuch agreements are absolutely critical, said Devon Streit, the deputy assistant secretary for infrastructure security at the Department of Energy, which is helping to coordinate the restoration of power. But in this instance, some companies were concerned about getting paid, she said, because the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, known as Prepa, had filed for bankruptcy protection in July after defaulting on $9 billion in debt.\n\nRicardo Ramos, chief executive of the power authority, said outside companies had been hesitant to come until they knew where the storm would make landfall. After that, he needed several days to assess the damage, and communications were down.\n\nBy the time Mr. Ramos had a full grasp of the damage a week after the storm, he said, the Corps of Engineers had been tasked with overseeing power restoration, a duty outside its usual purview.\n\nThat was something of a relief, Mr. Ramos said, because mutual aid agreements cost millions of dollars that the power authority cannot spare.\n\nWith the Corps of Engineers, they do the work, they pay for it, and they get reimbursed by FEMA, he said. So it never goes through my pocket.\n\nThe Montana company he hired, Whitefish Energy Holdings, agreed to do the work without a down payment. The chief executive, Andy Techmanski, said that he got the contract because he showed up in Puerto Rico unannounced.\n\nI mobilized what I could, which was private contractors, and I am happy with the decision. I would do exactly the same, he said. I think were right on target.\n\nThe Corps of Engineers did not announce its large contract, for $240 million, until this week. An earlier $35 million contract was for mobile gas turbines, but the Corps said it did not know when the companies would be sending employees to Puerto Rico.\n\nBrig. Gen. Diana Holland, the commander of the Corps South Atlantic Division, said the contracting process went really quickly, despite the fact that taxpayers demand a careful review of such emergency contracts.\n\nFor now, thousands of power poles remain on the ground. Most Puerto Ricans survive by storing food in ice chests or eating in the few open restaurants. They swat mosquitoes that fly in through the open windows, and some wait in line for hours to get ice. With about a third of the islands bank branches still closed, lines snake around the block for access to cash machines.\n\nLast night, someone tried to break into my house and into two of my neighbors houses to steal. They tried to force the lock on our door, said Mario Luis Casanova Caballero, a lineman working with Mr. Hernandez Sauri who was using a generator to power his lights and to help keep refrigerators running for three neighbors.\n\nWhen Hurricane Hugo hit in 1989, Mr. Ramos said, repairs took six months.\n\nBut on Saturday, Governor Rossello committed to a more aggressive timetable, pledging to have 95 percent of power restored by December. His public affairs secretary, Ramon Rosario Cortes, acknowledged that the crews in place were not enough.\n\nWe have 230 brigades. If we used only these brigades, wed be talking long months  years, Mr. Rosario said.\n\nThe governor said an additional 966 brigades would be trickling in over the next three weeks.\n\nThe number of workers, however, is not the only problem. The Corps of Engineers said damage to the islands ports had slowed shipments of needed equipment, including utility poles and cable.\n\nThe task is also daunting, Mr. Ramos said, because some of the power plants date to the 1950s and were never maintained. Power was restored to parts of San Juan three times in the last few weeks, only for the grid to collapse.\n\nAs he waits, Mr. Rodriguez tries to get by the best that he can.\n\nGenerators are expensive, he said, and hard to find. And lines at the supermarket remain long.\n\nI buy our drinking water in Costco, he said. I made a three-hour line on Sunday to buy eight gallons of water. Thats what were surviving on.",

      "title": "Estimated death toll in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria rises to 450", 
      "text": "The estimated death toll in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria, which slammed into the island on September 20, is far higher than previously stated, according to an investigation by Vox. As many as 450 people have died on the US territory, nearly ten times the official figure of 48.\n\nWe knew from reports on the ground, and investigative journalists whove also been looking into this, that this [the official figure] was very likely way too low of a number, Eliza Barclay, an editor at Vox, told USA Today in a report published yesterday.\n\nOn Thursday, only a few days after the initial Vox report on the death toll, US President Donald Trump met with Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rosello in Washington. He rated the response of the administration to the catastrophe a 10 out of 10. The comment demonstrated the contempt that the ruling elite has for the masses of workers on Puerto Rico, 80 percent of whom are still without power and will be for months.\n\nRossello joined in with the congratulations, though he did admit that a lot still has to be done.\n\nTrump again made clear that federal assistance will be minimal. The administration is helping a lot and it is costing a lot of money, he claimed, but at some point, FEMA has to leave, first responders have to leave and the people have to take over.\n\nVoxs estimate of the death toll includes those recorded in the official figure; 36 deaths reported by local news outlets; an NPR report of an additional 49 bodies sent to hospital morgues; and another 50 casualties in one region, reported in the Los Angeles Times. It also took into account reports from the Puerto Rican Center for Investigative Reporting of 69 morgues at full capacity, and a report from San Juans El Vocero of another 350 bodies awaiting autopsies at the Institute of Forensic Sciences.\n\nOn the one-month anniversary of Hurricane Maria, it is hard to imagine how things could be worse. The electrical blackout over most of the island is the longest in the history of the US. Forty percent of Puerto Ricans lack potable water, and thousands are forced to use water from wells contaminated with pollutants and sewage.\n\nEarlier this week, the mayor of Canovanas reported that several people in the city had died of Leptospirosis, a bacterial infection caused by polluted floodwaters. Dozens are dead from the disease throughout the country.\n\nA few days before the scheduled reopening of Puerto Rican public schools, parents are being told to provide extra food and bottled water for their children. Children with conjunctivitis, a symptom of Leptospirosis, have been told to stay home.\n\nJulia Keleher, Puerto Ricos education secretary, is calling on authorities to install or repair water fountains for students. The San Juan Star reports that Keleher has denounced government agencies for not giving her reports on the conditions of the schools after the hurricane, and for the fact that virtually all 1,100 Puerto Rican public schools remain littered with debris left over by the hurricanea major element in the Leptospirosis threat.\n\nWhen did the hurricane happen? How many days have passed? When are we resuming classes? At what schools is there still debris? declared the secretary. Despite the increasing threat of Leptospirosis, schools will reopen Monday. The debris does not make it impossible to resume classes, but it should not be happening, said Keleher, because the debris can bring other problems, such as Leptospirosis.\n\nMany teachers have had to carry out cleanup operations at schools themselves, due to the lack of coordinated reconstruction.\n\nOn Tuesday Eli Diaz, the executive director of the Puerto Rican Water and Sewer Authority, declared that water service would continue to be intermittent until the electric grid, on which much of the water system depends, is fully restored.\n\nThirty-four percent of households still are still totally without water. Even those that have water report that it often appears grayish-brown coming out of their faucets. Diaz has said that this is due to the clogging of water intakes from debris left behind by the hurricane.\n\nAs of last Tuesday, less than eighteen percent of households had electric service. The Puerto Rico blackout has now lasted longer than any blackout on the US mainland.\n\nThe hurricane caused an estimated $85 billion in damage in a country that is reeling from recession and faces the relentless demands of Wall Street creditors for more austerity and cuts in infrastructure and social programs to pay back their loans.",

He relies on an oxygen tank and suffers from spina bifida, as well as a host of other health issues, making it increasingly difficult to care for Macho without electricity or even clean water back on the island commonwealth.\n\nBut, less than three weeks after Maria swept their old lives away, the families, along with the Jorge Posada Foundation, managed to raise $15,000 for a charter flight to Miami, then another to Minnesota.\n\n\"I guess putting a face to all the tragedy that's happening is really opening everybody's eyes,\" Jaz said. \"If we didn't have everybody's help, there's no way we would've done it by ourselves.\"\n\nAs the weeks turn into months and the Marrero family settles in, local organizations are continuing the effort to help Puerto Rico rebuild--including events like the concert and fundraiser Thursday night at the Black Dog Cafe in St. Paul, organized by local Puerto Rican musician Maria Isa and other artists.\n\nIf you're interested in donating to help the victims of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, visit El Fondo Boricua, a fund of the St. Paul Foundation.",

      "title": "The Growing Risk of Leptospirosis in Puerto Rico", 
      "text": "Puerto Rico is in the midst of a prolonged humanitarian crisis after being struck by Hurricane Maria nearly one month ago. Much of Puerto Rico remains without electricity, clean drinking water, and limited gas. In addition, the US territory now faces a growing public health crisis, including increased risk of infectious diseases brought on by the conditions on the storm-ravaged island.\n\nDr. Rajeev Fernando, chief of infectious diseases at Stony Brook Southampton Hospital in New York, told ABC News that the number of sick people is expected to rise in the coming weeks because many infections have a 2-3-week incubation period. Specifically, this past week saw two confirmed cases of leptospirosis in Canovanas, a region on the northeast side of the island, with the CDC investigating a total of 10 suspected cases across the country. These cases, though small in number, are a significant concern for two reasons: 1) challenges to leptospirosis surveillance in general suggest the actual case count could be higher and 2) lack of medical infrastructure on the island increases the risk of infectious disease spread in the coming weeks.\n\nLeptospirosis is a bacterial infection caused by a corkscrew-shaped Leptospira bacterium. The mild form of the infection typically displays more generalizable symptoms such as headaches, muscle pain, and fever, while severe cases  also known as Weils disease or icteric leptospirosis  may present with pulmonary hemorrhage, meningitis, or kidney and liver failure. According to one systematic review of global leptospirosis morbidity and mortality, the worldwide case fatality rate is 5.72% (although this is believed to be an underestimate). The majority of the disease burden occurs in poor and tropical regions, particularly after heavy rain and flooding. Approximately 5%-10% of those with leptospirosis develop the severe form; the case fatality rate in those with severe disease is 5%-15%. Rodents are the primary source of infection to humans, but various wild and domestic animals can carry the bacterium.\n\nTransmission occurs when water contaminated with the urine of infected animals comes into contact with cuts, abrasions, or with the mucosal membranes of the eyes, nose, and mouth, or potentially through ingestion. Human-to-human transmission of leptospirosis is extremely rare; however, human infection of leptospirosis does show transient leptospiral shedding, and reports of infection have occurred through sexual transmission and lactation. Transplacental transmission may occur during pregnancy, resulting in abortion or stillbirth.\n\nWhile the Puerto Rico Department of Health reported 729 leptospirosis cases from 1990-2014, these data likely underestimate the true burden of disease. Data from a previously released CDC MMWR report suggest that 60%-90% of fatal leptospirosis cases in Puerto Rico are not reported. There are at least three reasons for this. First, according to the CDC report, there is a lack of timely diagnostic services, with current methods generally considered time-consuming and requiring advanced laboratory services not typically available in remote or underdeveloped locations. Second, due to similar symptom presentation as dengue, many cases might be misdiagnosed. This is of particular concern in areas where dengue is endemic, such as in Puerto Rico. A third contributing factor to the underreporting of leptospirosis is the number of asymptomatic cases. A serologic study done on a 1995 outbreak of leptospirosis in Nicaragua found that only 29.4% of 85 seropositive patients reported febrile illness within two months prior to antibody collection.\n\nA number of factors suggest that leptospirosis cases may become more prevalent in Puerto Rico in the weeks to come. While the scientific literature concerning post-hurricane infection with leptospirosis is scarce, one survey conducted during the 1996 leptospirosis outbreak in Puerto Rico found a more than 4-fold increase in laboratory-confirmed cases following Hurricane Hortense, from 4 out of 72 pre-hurricane patients, to 17 out of 70 post-hurricane patients. Additionally, out of the 17 confirmed cases of leptospirosis, 16 were male patients, who were believed to be at a greater risk for infection because of their assistance in post-hurricane relief work.\n\nFloodwaters also provide ideal conditions for leptospires survival. According to the above survey, flooding prevents [infected] animal urine from being absorbed into the soil or evaporating so leptospires may pass directly into the surface waters or persist in mud. Puerto Rico residents may contract the bacterium either by drinking contaminated floodwater or swimming with open sores.\n\nDr. Raul Hernandez, an internist based in San Juan, told Fox News that due to lack of safe drinking water, people are drinking from whatever water sources they can find  rivers, creeks. The Puerto Rico Department of Health urges people to drink only bottled water or to boil drinking water and to wear protective shoes near bodies of water that could be contaminated with animal urine. FEMA authorized $70 million to Puerto Rico to begin water restoration efforts. The challenges of responding to the public health crisis, including infectious disease outbreaks, is compounded by logistical realities. According to Puerto Rico government officials, as of October 19, over 82% of the island remains without power, over 28% of water meters are inactive, and only 36 of 65 hospitals have electricity, and even those with power may be running at limited capacity.\n\nOutbreak Observatory aims to collect information on challenges and solutions associated with outbreak response and share it broadly in near-real time to allow others to learn from these experiences in order to improve global outbreak response capabilities.",

      "text": "The people of Puerto Rico are still in a state of endless disaster, with Donald Trump spurning any attempt to put in serious effort to help the Americans trapped there without water or power.\n\nAnd the situation is only getting worse, as many tasked with helping the island seem to have actively malicious impulses.\n\nThis week, news broke that Whitefish Energy  a company in Montana that is financed by a Trump donor and hails from the same town as Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke  unexpectedly received a $300 million contract to rebuild Puerto Ricos power grid.\n\nThe choice was highly unusual. Most utilities have mutual aid agreements to rebuild one anothers infrastructure in the event of a natural disaster, and do not hire outside for-profit companies. Moreover, Whitefish had only two full-time employees when Hurricane Maria landed, lacks adequate insurance, and is paying each of its subcontractors over $300 per hour.\n\nTo make matters worse, Whitefish promptly got into a fight with San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, who raised concerns about the arrangement, and made a flippant but very disturbing threat to leave the island to its fate:\n\nFor a company charged by the government with disaster relief to say that to the mayor of a destroyed city is absolutely appalling. Whitefish is essentially saying, stop asking questions or well leave you to rot.\n\nWhitefish may not get away with bilking and threatening the citizens of Puerto Rico for long. After a meeting with FEMA in which even federal officials raised red flags, Gov. Ricardo Rossello ordered the Office of the Inspector General to investigate how Whitefish came to win the contract. The House Natural Resources Committee is looking into it as well.\n\nThe mark of decency is how a person treats others in a time of desperation. Whitefish blatantly profiteering off of hurricane victims is the lowest of the low.",

      "text": "The morning of the storm, as the transformer powering their public housing complex began to flicker out, Jimenez and her husband fled with Victoria, machines in hand, to a hospital clinic about three minutes from their home. The storm eventually downed power in every other building in the neighborhood, Jimenez recalled, save the clinics backup generator that kept the lights on. When the clinics generator also began to run out of fuel over the weekend, the tiny family took an ambulance 10 miles away to Hospital Metropolitano Dr. Pila in Ponce on the southern coast of the island.\n\nOn October 15, Victoria and her mother were finally airlifted to Miami by a group called Warrior Angels Rescue that arranges evacuations for people with urgent medical needs. They were supposed to be transported from the airport to a childrens hospital in the city. But that didnt happen. When the plane landed, a mix-up among the paramedics on the ground led Jimenez and her daughter to be shuttled 20 miles north to Joe DiMaggios Childrens Hospital in Hollywood, [Ernie Martinez, an advocate for the family] said.\n\nSince that time, Victoria and her mother have encountered one bureaucratic incompetence after anotherincluding applying to FEMA for aid but not receiving enough to cover housing.\n\nJoe DiMaggios Childrens Hospital in Hollywood, where they ended up, tried to turn them away before verifying the babys infection and admitting her to stabilize her condition, the mother said. [...] There, Jimenez quickly discovered  contrary to what she had been told  that the Medicaid that had kept Victoria alive in Puerto Rico had not followed them to the mainland. They started to ask me if the baby had insurance, she said. Before they even checked her, they asked if she had insurance here. A staffer took her information, she said, then returned and told her her Puerto Rico insurance was not valid. Then, she recalled, a staffer told her to leave. [...] But after four days, the Hollywood hospital discharged Victoria to a temporary AirBnB rental that expires at the end of the month. Advocates and her mother say Victoria still needs more medical attention and, come November, somewhere to live unless lagging disaster response funds come through or a hospital readmits her. To add to the challenges, Victorias mom is struggling to get medication for her own blood clot disorder.\n\nSo lets recap. Victoria is a very sick baby with life-threatening conditions. Her mother also has a serious health condition. Post-hurricane, Victoria was sent to the Miami to get the care she couldnt get in Puerto Rico. And yet, shes been turned away once, told that her insurance cant cover health care in Florida, finally admitted to the hospital for four days and released, and funds from FEMA are not enough to cover the costs of housing. And sadly, this is not the only case where this is happening. Hospitals and social structures in the U.S. have not been prepared to deal with the special needs of children, families and the elderly evacuated from Puerto Rico and they are being met with delays in care and bureaucratic mishaps. This doesnt sound like a country or healthcare system that values anyones lifeleast of all the lives of women and children first.\n\nEven if we are an imperfect country with flawed structures, there are some things worth our time and investment to get right. Denying health care to our children, especially the most vulnerable ones in their time of need, is appalling, undignified and criminal. Its also far from the best we can do. If history is going to judge us on how we take care those in need, we are going to fail miserably.",

      "title": "Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority Cancels Whitefish Energy Deal", 
      "text": "I want to clarify, so its very clear, that the cancellation of this contract does not respond to an acceptance that there was something outside of the law or out of line with [PREPAs] procedures of emergency contracts, Ramos said.\n\nSo far, PREPA has paid or been billed for over $20 million by Whitefish, according to Ramos. He said there wouldnt be a penalty for canceling the contract, but that PREPA would have to pay for Whitefish to remove their equipment from the island as well as whatever work they complete by mid-November, which he expected to total at least an additional $10.9 million.\n\nThe contracts cancellation, which wont go into effect for 30 days per the contracts terms, isnt expected to stop any work the company currently has in progress. But it could delay other grid restoration efforts by 10 to 12 weeks, Ramos said.\n\nThe controversy that the contract has generated is truly immense, said Ramos, adding that he had been summoned by Congress to answer questions. Its a huge distraction. So as I understand it, its the better of two evils to cancel the contract.\n\nWe are very disappointed in the decision by Governor Rossello to ask PREPA to cancel the contract which led to PREPAs announcement this afternoon, reads the statement. We only wish the best for the great people of Puerto Rico. We are very proud of our contributions to the islands recovery and proud of the tremendous work that our team has done under very challenging conditions.\n\nThe clause that shields the contractor from audit or review is a red flag of overcharging, said Tiefer. The contractor works for PREPA, not the other way around. I cant imagine how any responsible government official could put such an anti-audit clause into a government contract.\n\nThere were other concerning details in the contract, like the high rates Whitefish was charging for labor. The company was paying $240 an hour for a general foreman and $227 for a lineman. For some context, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said first-line supervisors of construction sites make about $43 an hour and construction laborers make about $23 an hour.\n\nWhitefish was also paying for expensive food and lodging for its employees. The contract stated that each person could spend nearly $80 a day for meals and $332 a day for lodging. Flights for employees were being billed at $1,000 each way.\n\nCertainly, if the situation that is going on in the U.S. with the media was not happening ... there [would be] no need for the cancellation of the contract, Ramos said. Were managing risks. There is a perception risk, a reputational risk, and a delay risk in continuing with the contract.\n\nSteve Schooner, a former high-ranking government contracting official who is now a law professor at George Washington University, said the Whitefish contract has given him great material for his classes because there are so many problems with it.\n\nNot everyone said the contract was stunningly out of the ordinary. Scott Amey, general counsel for the Project On Government Oversight, wrote a blog post about why he thinks the contract raised concerns but was mostly normal, given bigger problems surrounding many federal contracts.\n\nStill, Amey told HuffPost that its odd that the contract gave Whitefish the ability to delay its work without any accountability. He said that clause allowed the company to potentially prolong its work so it got paid the entire $300 million  and then push to extend the contract for even more money.",

When a person comes into contact with water, mud or soil that has been contaminated by an infected animals urine, the bacteria can enter the body through open abrasions or mucous membranes in the eyes, nose and mouth, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The current conditions in Puerto Rico are ripe for this type of infection.\n\nThe disease often mimics many viral infections, making it hard to diagnose, Capo said. It is often underreported or misdiagnosed as dengue, a viral disease transmitted via mosquitoes. But unlike dengue, leptospirosis can be treated early on by using antibiotics. If left untreated, in some strains of the disease, patients may hemorrhage in the lungs or experience kidney failure and die.\n\nThe suspicion is so great that you dont need to wait for lab results\n\nThere are cases, that despite not being confirmed, the suspicion is so great that you dont need to wait for lab results, said Dr. Cruz, whose name has been changed because he did not have permission to speak on record. There was a patient, a 28-year-old man that in less than five days the disease killed him.\n\nOnce its too late, Ill be blunt, the patient will die\n\nWe have all of the elements for that bacteria to grow and spread, and with preventative antibiotics, we can save lives, Dr, Cruz added. Because once its too late, Ill be blunt, the patient will die regardless of what we do. And its up to a 70 percent mortality rate if the infection reaches the lungs.\n\nWe never imagined that he would die\n\nRomero said his brother, who lived in Guaynabo, lost 15 pounds in the days that the disease progressed, something that was devastating for his family to witness after having known him as a fit and healthy man. He also said he hoped his brother, who was the father to a 7-year-old girl, will be remembered for how much he loved to help people.",

      "title": "Whitefish Company Wins Power Restoration Contract In Puerto Rico", 
      "text": "A small company in Whitefish has won a major contract to restore power to Puerto Rico following widespread outages from Hurricane Maria. Nicky Ouellet reports theres some confusion over why the Montana company was chosen.\n\nWhitefish Energy Holdings is relatively new to the Flathead Valley. The company was established in 2015. It doesnt have an office and only lists two employees. Yet it won a bid with the Puerto Rico Power Electric Authority, or PREPA, to rebuild more than 100 miles of downed transmission lines following a near system failure after two hurricanes hit the island in September. The contract is garnering national attention. The Weather Channel had a story this week:\n\n\"Something fishy is going on in Puerto Rico, and its not just the name of the company involved. Whitefish Energy Holdings was awarded a contract to restore power to the island by the local power authority, but no one can figure out why,\" says the Weather Channel story.\n\nI tried getting in touch with Whitefish Energy for a week. They referred to me to their public relations firm, but no one would give me an interview. So I called Ricardo Ramos, PREPA's chief executive officer. He spoke on the phone from San Juan.\n\n\"We knew there was going to be a direct hit, so we wanted as much resources as possible. Their name popped up on several fronts,\" Ramos says.\n\nRamos says PREPA received bids from a few companies in the lull after Hurricane Irma hit the island, but before Hurricane Maria made landfall. PREPA, which filed for bankruptcy in July, shortlisted to two, including Whitefish Energy.\n\n\"Just before hurricane Maria came, one of those two requested a payment guarantee that we thought was a bit onerous, so we decided to mobilize Whitefish [Energy],\" Ramos says.\n\nWhitefish did not ask for a payment guarantee. It signed a contract for an undisclosed amount to rebuild three to four transmission lines  or more than 100 miles of PREPAs total 2,500 miles of lines. PREPA is open to expanding the contract in the future.\n\nThis is just one aspect of power restoration on Puerto Rico, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is overseeing other parts of the effort and recently awarded a $240 million contract to a Texas-based corporation for power restoration.\n\nUsually after a catastrophic power outage, utility companies call a trade organization to initiate mutual aid. The American Public Power Association organizes a network of state and regional public power utilities to restore electricity quickly.\n\nBut PREPA never made that call. Ramos says thats because his utility lost communication within and outside the island following Hurricane Marias landfall.\n\n\"Just a matter of the timing. Hurricane came, all communications went down, our servers were down,\" says Ramos.\n\nBy the time communications came back online, President Donald Trump had declared a major disaster on the island, and FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, stepped in. FEMA charged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to oversee power restoration work, which will be paid for using federal funds for the first 180 days.\n\nIts unclear why PREPA didnt call for mutual aid when it contracted Whitefish Energy. Ramos says PREPA has paid Whitefish Energy about $2 million for its mobilization and work through October 11.\n\nIts now been a month since Maria hit. PREPA reports that its running at 19 percent of its power generation capabilities.\n\n\"Everything is working OK according to our expectations,\" Ramos says.\n\nWhitefish Energy made a splash in the Flathead Valley last December, when CEO Andy Techmanski announced to news outlets he planned to build a transformer manufacturing plant at the former Columbia Falls Aluminum Company site. CFAC is currently a federally managed Superfund Site.\n\nTechmanski told reporters hed need the two local utilities to purchase about $20 million in pre-ordered transformers. Neither utility chose to do so.\n\nWendy Ostrom-Price is the public relations officer for Flathead Electric Co-op, one of the utilities Techmanski approached. She says Flathead Electric did contract Whitefish Energy to replace a transformer in the Libby area.\n\n\"We are scheduled to have that transformer delivered sometime before the end of the year.\"\n\nOstrom-Price declined to specify the dollar amount of that contract.\n\nContracting Whitefish Energy was a question mark at first, because the company is 51 percent owned by a Brazilian corporation, called COMTRAFO. Flathead Electric follows federal Buy American Act standards, meaning that at least half of the components in the equipment they use need to be built in the USA.\n\nOstom-Price says Flathead Electric did its homework.\n\n\"We know that over 50 percent of components used in this transformer and construction thereof is done in U.S.\"\n\nMeanwhile in Puerto Rico, Whitefish Energy has been posting daily updates to social media. This one features CEO Andy Techmanski.\n\nWhitefish Energy says it has 240 workers on the ground. A portion of those workers are subcontracted from Jacksonville Electric Authority in Florida. A spokesperson says Jacksonville Electric is committed to up to 90 days of work with Whitefish Energy.\n\nOfficials estimate repairs will last about six months.",

      "title": "How a month of hurricane nightmares changed Puerto Rico -- and me", 
      "text": "CNN's Leyla Santiago has been in Puerto Rico since before Hurricane Maria hit one month ago.\n\nSan Juan, Puerto Rico (CNN) I am writing this in the dark. The hotel doesn't have power, and one of the generators failed. I had to walk up 10 flights of stairs to get to my hotel room because the elevators don't work. The lights have been flickering all night.\n\nSuch is life here.\n\nIf that's my biggest problem, however, I consider myself lucky.\n\nIt has upended the lives of 3.4 million people. It has cut off entire towns from each other. It has left residents without water to drink or bathe in. Enough aid has not come for many. The gravity of the recovery time is starting to set in.\n\nMaria also devastated the people I call family, and destroyed the island that molded me into the person I am today. So for me, covering the devastation was personal. I owed it to the island that has given me so much. I was born here, and while I left when I was 3, I have returned for so many holidays. It's where I spent my summers and where I was married.\n\nI fought the winds as the Category 4 storm smashed into Puerto Rico on September 20 and then reported the devastation around San Juan.\n\nMost roads were closed so to see the impact outside the capital, we had to take to the air.\n\nI was flying over an island I didn't recognize. It had no color. The once lush trees had been stripped of all shades of green. It was hard to find any power lines still standing. Even the typically bright turquoise of the ocean was muted.\n\nWe flew to some of the most remote, rural and hardest hit areas: Yauco, Utuado and Quebradillas. I will never forget how I was greeted.\n\nWhen our chopper touched down in Quebradillas, a woman ran to embrace me. She was crying, desperately explaining she needed to reach her family in New Jersey. She hugged tightly, and didn't let go quickly. I was the first outsider she had seen since the hurricane hit.\n\nWord spread quickly. The town surrounded us within minutes. No one knew who we were. They didn't ask for food or money. They were curious. Did we have cell service? Did we know what was happening in other towns?\n\nAs with other towns, we were their only source of news and the only way to share their own. They begged for help relaying messages home.\n\nI asked for a list of names, numbers and a message. I promised them I would call later.\n\nThen it was time to leave. Amid the chaos, I didn't even get the woman's name.\n\nAs we left Quebradillas to return to San Juan, the pilot asked if I needed to see anything else.\n\nI asked him to fly over Corozal, a mountainous community in the interior.\n\nHe said we didn't have enough fuel to land, but a flyover was feasible. When he announced \"This is Corozal,\" I was scared to look out the window. I was dreading what I would see.\n\n\"Whoa, it looks like a bomb went off here,\" the pilot says.\n\nHe didn't know it was my hometown, where my family has lived since the 1800s.\n\nI had to look.\n\nI didn't recognize what I saw. Trees were down, debris was scattered everywhere. For a few minutes, I couldn't even find a landmark to orient myself at all to the town I called home.\n\nAnd I couldn't control the tears as we circled the destruction from above. I felt so helpless having family down there, but not being able to land, to reach them.\n\nI snapped a picture. I left with a lot of guilt, thinking Corozal should have been my first stop.\n\nWhen I got back to the hotel, I called my family in Florida. I told them Corozal didn't look good, but I couldn't bring myself to share the photo.\n\nAnd then my crew and I pulled out the names and numbers given to me earlier to call friends and families and deliver news.\n\nWe made call after call, trying to share as much as we could with loved ones.\n\nA couple of days after flying over Corozal, I overheard that the road was now clear.\n\nSoon, I was on that road. For 45 minutes from San Juan to Corozal, my heart was pounding.\n\nWe stopped at a shelter on the way to my family's street.\n\nI was appalled. More than 120 people were now living in the town's high school classrooms. There were children with asthma, an elderly woman with Parkinson's disease, and a woman with cancer. The staff was struggling to meet their needs. The generator was out. All of the food in the refrigerator had spoiled. The bathrooms were becoming unsanitary. People needed medicine.\n\nIt had been nine days since the hurricane. Corozal was in horrible shape. They needed help. And after seeing the shelter, I needed to find my family.\n\nI went straight to my uncle's house. I'm not sure if I waited for the car to stop before I jumped out. I saw my uncle's car shop was destroyed, the roof completely ripped off. I walked in through the open door and shouted his name from the living room. That's when I saw him, and my other family members.\n\nThey were OK.\n\nMy uncle Jesus and I couldn't stop hugging. He kept describing the damage as we hugged.\n\n\"I know, Tio, I flew over here a few days ago but I couldn't land,\" I admitted to my uncle in tears.\n\n\"It's OK,\" he said as he hugged me again. \"We're OK.\"\n\nAnd that's all I needed to hear.\n\nAs days turned into weeks, the reality of the scope of damage across the island has become even more clear.\n\nTo tell the story of what life has become, we decided to try to find the woman from the mountainside who hugged me so tightly just days after the hurricane.\n\nWe headed to her municipality, asking around and showing the video of the hug on my cell phone. We found a family member who showed us to her home. Her name was Brenda.\n\nShe immediately recognized me, and gave me another tight hug. Not much help has arrived since my last visit.\n\nIn fact, conditions have grown so bad after Maria, they are tearing apart her family.\n\nOne of Brenda's children decided the conditions were no longer safe, that her 3-year-old grandchildren should go to Florida and Connecticut, where they had other family.\n\nThree years old. That's the age when I left Puerto Rico, with my military family for a posting in Panama and then South Carolina. The circumstances are so different, but I know those children's lives will change forever.\n\nBut then, Puerto Rico has also changed forever.\n\nThe struggles are everywhere. And where there is help or supplies, there are lines, always lines.\n\nSome days, it would be people lining up for gas. And then for food at the supermarket. The longest lines were now to use the ATM.\n\nI became numb to the lines quickly.\n\nWhen we passed another long one at the port, I didn't think anything of it. Until it hit me.\n\nThousands were lining up to leave Puerto Rico. I watched as an old man dragged an oxygen tank, while pleading with organizers to let him on that massive cruise ship now acting as a refugee transport. Another man lifted his shirt to show the scars from an operation, hoping it would convince the right people that he needed to get off the island.\n\nThe last time I saw a cruise ship anchored here, I could hear music and laughter coming from tourists on board. This time, there were no celebrations. These weren't tourists. The ship would soon be filled with thousands of Puerto Ricans carrying suitcases fleeing the hurricane-ravaged island.\n\nHow could one hurricane force so many to leave their homes?\n\nThe images unfolding before my eyes reminded me of scenes from the 1950s, when a wave of Puerto Ricans left the island, most permanently. Many in today's exodus said the plan was to \"come back.\" I couldn't help but wonder how many would actually return.\n\nAs the line dwindled, my heart seemed to do the same. The sun set. All passengers boarded. The horn blasted, and I sobbed. I shed more tears for that line than anything else I encountered on this island over the last month.\n\nI found myself humming the words to a famous song in Puerto Rico. It is the song my grandfather sang to me when I was a child back in Corozal, \"En Mi Viejo San Juan.\"\n\nMy dream, after Maria, is that someday they will return -- to the island I remember.",

      "title": "Lin-Manuel Miranda Joins Warhol and Rauschenberg Foundations in Hurricane Maria Relief Effort", 
      "text": "Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico on September 20th, devastating the island and its residents, artists among them. In response to the destruction, international organizations have sent money, medical supplies, and other forms of aid. And on Tuesday, the Andy Warhol Foundation, the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation and Lin Manuel-Miranda (through The Hispanic Federation) announced they will each provide $100,000 in emergency grants to a hurricane relief fund run by San Juan-based arts organization Beta-Local.\n\nThe total $300,000 in grants will go to bolster Beta-Locals efforts aimed at both immediate recovery and the long-term rebuilding of shared community spaces and resources.\n\nThe aid is sorely needed. Just weeks after Puerto Rico weathered Hurricane Irma (from which 60,000 people had yet to regain power), Maria made landfall as the fifth strongest storm ever to hit the United States and the strongest to hit the island in 80 years. The official death toll is almost at 50 as of Saturday. Thousands have fled, while the roughly three million residents who have stayed on the island continue to face struggles finding basic necessities almost a month after the storm. More than 1.2 million Puerto Ricans lack potable water and approximately 117 residents remain unaccounted for, according to CNN.\n\nWith recovery efforts likely to last months and possibly years, myriad local groups have offered supportBeta-Local among them. Were taking it day by day, said Sofia Gallisa Muriente, Beta-Locals co-director. This hurricane has created a rupture, a really deep rupture in every aspect.\n\nBeta-Locals emergency fund for the countrys cultural workers will go to both long-term and short-term relief, including aiding local communities by working to remove hurricane debris and repair damage, and distribution donations like food, water, and other supplies.\n\nWere still dealing with a lot of really urgent needs and that triage period after a disaster, Gallisa Muriente said.\n\nBeta-Local has reached out to those with links to the organization and their families through online and on-the-ground efforts. The analog work of talking to people and visiting different parts of the island, different studios or workshops, she said, allows the organization to identify how we can best support people and projects in dialogue with them.\n\nThe donation to Beta-Local is in line with the Andy Warhol Foundations general mission of supporting artists, including during emergencies, said Rachel Bers, the foundations program director, in an email. She worked with Beta-Local in 2014, adding that we have confidence in their ability to know whats happening on the ground.\n\nWhile Bers lauded the strength and cohesion of the islands artistic community in the aftermath of the hurricane she noted that Puerto Rico and its artists are in a very vulnerable, financially precarious position even in the best of times. The territory has been gripped by a decade-long economic recession and a recent debt crisis, even before the pair of hurricanes struck the island.\n\nBeta-Locals efforts are bolstered by both local and international collaborators who can raise funds and awareness. While Gallisa Muriente encouraged those thinking about ways to help to donate to their emergency fund or buy supplies from the organizations Amazon registry, she added that there are a lot of ways of being an ally in solidarity with Puerto Rico right now, from outside of this country.\n\nIts important for people to realize how much they can do that we cant do ourselves right now, Gallisa said. Their power to advocate for Puerto Rico...I think more than ever now, its really clear to everyone just how important that international solidarity is.",

      "text": "The Santa Rosa well on the Superfund site, from which water has been distributed by the Puerto Rican water utility, contained only trace amounts of PCE, an industrial chemical, according to the tests run by the Virginia Tech Water Quality Lab. The other two wells at the Dorado Superfund site, called Maguayo 2 and Maguayo 4, showed no signs of industrial contamination.\n\nMarc Edwards, the professor at Virginia Tech who conducted the tests for CNN, said the low level of contamination put even the Santa Rosa well safely within clean drinking water standards. All three wells are safe, he said. \"I would drink\" this water, he told CNN on Thursday.\n\n\"This water you sent me is meeting all federal safe drinking water standards,\" said Edwards. \"How that happened? It could be the way the water flows on the ground (that's) not bringing contamination from the Superfund site to the well. Or maybe they are using some sort of treatment technology.\"",

      "text": "The United States is deporting people from southeastern Texas again after taking a brief break in enforcement during Hurricane Harvey rescue and recovery efforts.\n\nThe administration of Donald Trump announced the change, saying that everyone in the country illegally is on the chopping block there, but that response operations would still not be subjected to raids.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement officers have resumed regular, targeted immigration enforcement operations in the area  with the exception of immediate relief operations like shelters and food banks, a statement from that agency said in a statement.\n\nThe agency suspended immigration-related arrests as Hurricane Harvey approached southeastern Texas last month, saying that their immediate priority was to promote life-saving and life-sustaining activities, according to a statement then.\n\nDuring that time, more than 200 officers from the agency were sent to help with relief efforts. Those agents were likely to instil a degree of fear for undocumented immigrants in the area, as the Trump administration has arrested more than 6,200 immigrants in the area since Mr Trump took office. In response, federal, state, and local officials urged the 600,000 immigrants in the Houston to seek aid if they needed it. They promised no repercussions for doing so.\n\nThose urgings reportedly werent enough to convince people to seek shelter and aid. Many people stayed at home, according to the Houston Chronicle, choosing to ride out the risk of devastating floods instead of opening themselves up to the potential for deportation.\n\nWith so many people staying home, some advocates said that the situation became dire. Its a real crisis, Cesar Espinosa, the executive director of the immigrant advocacy group FIEL Houston, said.\n\nMr Trump vowed during the 2016 campaign to immediately deport people who are in the United States illegally, in spite of expert claims that it would be incredibly difficult if not impossible to do so logistically. After the President took office earlier this year, he directed his immigration agency to begin working on his goal of meeting 2 to 3 million undocumented immigrants.\n\nIn spite of that effort, deportations in the Trump era were lower during the first six months of the year compared to the past several years when Barack Obama was president.",

      "text": "The Ramashan Mosque outside of Houston is one of the few buildings in the area that has not been hard by flooding, but if you think that means the people currently barricaded inside will be helping their neighbors you have another thing coming.\n\nThe building can easily hold over 500 people, much more than the 27 currently inside. But the imam of the mosque, Aswat Turads, says that they absolutely cannot accept any non-Muslim people because its against their religion.\n\nThe Quran is very clear, Turads told local news radio station WXTX, we are forbidden from helping infidels, no matter how much we want to. If we allow Christians and Jews inside, we are violating a fundamental tenant of Islam and will be punished by Allah.\n\nTurads says that the mosque has donated more than $500 to relief efforts despite their inability to provide shelter for those who need it the most.\n\nThis is inexcusable. No matter what your religion, you should be willing to help your community. Christian churches all over Texas are doing their parts to help. Why cant Muslims do the same?",

      "title": "Mosques across Houston have opened their dfeelrs to flood victims, keeping them warm, safe and fed", 
      "text": "As the murky floodwaters of Hurricane Harvey kept rising, a vast mosque here - like several others across the state - opened its doors to Americans of all faiths. It offered a dry place to sleep, diaper-changing stations, endless coffee and sweet tea, and warm trays of Pakistani and Syrian rice dishes.\n\nThere are an estimated 250,000 Muslims who live across the Houston area, one of the most diverse cities in the country. Their mosques and charitable organizations were some of the first to open their doors during the disaster to offer supplies and shelter to their neighbors.\n\n\"Look, helping is a total no-brainer. You don't even have to discuss or debate it,\" said M.J. Khan, president of the Islamic Society of Greater Houston, who started to load up on fans, towels and bedding last weekend as the rain began to fall. \"It's part of our faith and part of being human. I always feel that this is why God created human beings: for us to help each other.\"\n\nMuslim families on Friday were celebrating the Eid al-Adha festival, one of Islam's holiest days, coinciding with the hajj, or pilgrimage, to the Islamic holy city of Mecca. Part of the holiday's mission is giving to the poor, and Muslims traditionally slaughter livestock and offer the meat to those less fortunate.\n\nGirls were dressed in puffy and sparkly dresses and boys wore bow-ties they had received as donations from friends and neighbors who had not flooded. Their mothers, surrounded with the smoky, sweet smell of oud, a perfume worn on special occasions, wore dresses and headscarves.\n\nFamilies at the Brand Lane Islamic Center, which includes cricket fields, a playground and elementary and middle schools, handed out Syrian pastries and cookies to a multifaith gathering. Islamic leaders said that despite large crowds arriving for prayer, it was important to them that hurricane evacuees feel welcome to stay.\n\n\"They're No. 1. They will not be disturbed, they will not be displaced, they will not be moved,\" said Khan, who operates the Champions mosque and several others that are providing shelter to Muslims and people of other faiths. He said the evacuees took precedence over his congregants. \"If they have to pray in the parking lot, they'll pray in the parking lot.\"\n\nThe Islamic Society of Triplex, a Beaumont mosque, has donated hundreds of meals - as well as volunteer medical care - to their neighbors displaced by floods, even though many of the mosque's members also had to evacuate their homes south of Houston, said Amna Ahmed, a member of the mosque.\n\nMosque members on Thursday night delivered meals to an estimated 500 people at the city's two emergency shelters. One mosque member, who is a physician, also visited the shelters offering his services free of charge, Ahmed said.\n\nThis weekend, the mosque plans to bring another large supply of meals to a base where first responders were launching in Port Arthur.\n\nThe relationship between Muslims and their surrounding communities in Texas, as in other parts of the country, has been strained at times in an atmosphere of rising anti-Muslim sentiments and hate crimes.\n\nAt the Stafford mosque, dozens of neighbors of all faiths brought in cases of bottled water and canned goods this week.\n\nMountasser Kadrie, a professor of medicine who is Syrian-American, was staying at the mosque's makeshift shelter during Harvey's relentless rain when he saw \"a few big white guys with tattoos coming to the mosque in a huge truck.\"\n\nThey got ready to offer them shelter, he said.\n\n\"But he was bringing us cases of water - I mean in bad flooding - raining like hell,\" he said. \"I mean, I just sat down and I cried. I was so mentally exhausted after the flooding, and this just really choked me up.\"\n\nHe showed pictures of the three young men and said perceptions on all sides were changed.\n\n\"This,\" he said, \"is America, our truest selves.\"\n\nMuslims here said they were simply trying to help neighbors. But in the process, members of different communities got to know each other better.\n\nSitting inside the Champions mosque's gym, one non-Muslim woman told the Associated Press that she was very grateful to make it to the mosque.\"\n\n\"Muslims are just like any other type of person. They're caring, loving, giving people,\" Katherine McCusker said. \"I feel very fortunate that they were open and willing to come and have this space.\"\n\nNon-Muslims who were being housed in mosques have taken to social media and said they really enjoyed the Muslim tradition of hospitality. Many also didn't mind that women and men are separated at night because women said they felt as though they were getting their privacy, among strangers.\n\nMany in the Muslim activist community were also busy helping, including Saira Siddiqui, who writes a popular blog and is a PhD student in social justice.\n\nShe was connecting people's distress messages with volunteer boaters and the Coast Guard. She helped them find pregnant women, young children and people with disabilities of all faiths.\n\nSiddiqui also said she was going to offer assistance to anyone who needs help filling out federal emergency assistance forms.\n\n\"Tomorrow there's going to be a volunteer training session at someone's home where we'll be led and instructed by professionals on home cleanup postflood,\" she said.\n\nShe also drove to an Indian restaurant because she got a call that they were preparing food for 500 people. A group of Muslims went to pick it up and drop it off at a temple close by. She said that people's hearts \"aren't changed by facts and figures. They're changed by stories.\"\n\nBy getting to know one another, \"this disaster shed all artificial boundaries,\" she said. \"We were one. One community. One city. For a brief moment, we stopped caring about any differences and distinctions. It was simply: Do you need my help? What can I do for you?\"\n\nDoes she think it'll stay this way?\n\n\"No, of course not,\" she said. \"But I think this was an opportunity for us to simply get to know one another. And that is what will bring about long-term change.",

My initiative is donating $200m to the entire Houston community to assist and house victims of the devastating flood that has rendered people homeless. The fund is intended to provide shelter, food, clothing and medicines.  Mayweather added.\n\nOn Sunday, sprawling and soaked Houston metro area and other deluged towns in southeast Texas were braced for devastating floods and pummeling rainfall as Tropical Storm Harvey stalled over land and drenched dogged searchers and anxious residents.\n\nA flash flood emergency was in effect for parts of the Houston area. National Weather Service and local officials advised Houston-area residents to avoid traveling.\n\nThree to 4 inches of rainfall were reported in the region in one hours time. First responders investigated the report of a woman swept away in her vehicle by floodwaters.\n\n Stay put, the National Weather Service said.\n\nIt was confirmed the downpour is going to last four to five days.\n\nWith dire warnings of tornadoes, torrential downpours and days of flooding to come, broad swaths of southeast Texas were littered with uprooted trees, toppled signs, flagpoles that snapped like toothpicks and clusters of bricks peeled like scabs from walls and rooftops.\n\nAdditional fatalities were feared in Rockport, where an estimated 5,000 residents had stayed put for the storm that blasted ashore as a Category 4 around 11 p.m. ET Friday between Port Aransas and Port OConnor.\n\nThe flood damage is expected to cost tens of billions and there are concerns for the longer-term health of people caught up in muddy floodwaters.",

      "title": "Puerto Rico power authority moves to cancel controversial Whitefish contract", 
      "text": "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico  The head of Puerto Ricos power authority moved on Sunday to cancel a controversial contract with Whitefish Energy, the small Montana company under scrutiny for the deal worth hundreds of millions to help restore power to the hurricane-ravaged island.\n\nThe announcement of the upcoming cancellation came just a few hours after Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello asked the board of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) to cancel the contract with Whitefish during a news conference on Sunday morning.\n\nPREPA CEO Ricardo Ramos said during a news conference Sunday afternoon that he accepted the governor's recommendation and would be writing a letter to the board of directors \"asking for a resolution that will allow me to cancel the contract,\" adding that the contract was not officially canceled as of yet.\n\nRamos added that the plan was for Whitefish to \"finish what they started,\" which was work on two transmission lines on the island.\n\nHe added that he hoped to speak with officials at Whitefish within the next few hours and that the contract required a 30-day notice for cancellation.\n\n\"Even if I cancel today it becomes effective in 30 days,\" he added.\n\nEarlier Sunday, Gov. Rossello said he was calling on PREPA to cancel the contract out of public interest.\n\nIn light of the information that has come about with regards to the contracting of Whitefish Energy and in the interests of protecting our public interests I have asked the board of the power authority to invoke the cancellation clause in the contract immediately, Rossello said.\n\nThere can be no distraction that alters the commitment to lift up the electrical system as quickly as possible, he added in a post on social media.\n\nThe governor had previously called for the Office of the Comptroller to investigate and audit the contracting process of the company by PREPA.\n\nThe governor also called for the installation of a \"special outside coordinator\" in terms of contracts and purchases, \"so that we can have more clarity in this process.\"\n\nRamos said he will follow the governor's suggestion and will move to cancel the contract. Ramos said that the move to cancel the deal comes after the controversy over the contract, but did not signal that there was anything \"outside of the law\" with the agreement.\n\nHe added that Whitefish had been doing a great job but that political distractions had snowballed.\n\nRamos said the cancellation will not stop any work the company currently has in progress, but could delay other grid-restoration efforts by 10 to 12 weeks. He also said it would cost PREPA additional money to demobilize the contract.\n\nWhitefish Energy said in a statement Sunday evening that it was \"very disappointed\" that the governor asked PREPA to cancel the contract, \"which led to PREPA's announcement this afternoon.\"\n\n\"The decision will only delay what the people of Puerto Rico want and deserve  to have the power restored quickly in the same manner their fellow citizens on the mainland experience after a natural disaster,\" the company said in the statement. \"We will certainly finish any work that PREPA wants us to complete and stand by our commitments knowing that we made an important contribution to the restoration of the power grid since our arrival on the island on October 2.\"\n\nThe company said it was proud of the work it had done and that in less than a month, it had \"brought 350 workers with specific expertise in this task and were on track to have more than 500 linesmen on the island by this week if allowed to continue.\"\n\n\"We only wish the best for the great people of Puerto Rico. We are very proud of our contributions to the island's recovery and proud of the tremendous work that our team has done under very challenging conditions,\" the statement added.\n\nThe chief executive of Whitefish Energy, Andy Techmanski, told NBC News from San Juan on Saturday that he first made contact with officials on Puerto Rico through the business networking site LinkedIn shortly after Hurricane Irma hit in September  and not through any previous connections. He said he kept in contact with them through Hurricane Maria's devastation.\n\n\"I think that there are people out there on a witch hunt looking for something that does not exist,\" he said.\n\nIrma knocked out power to one million customers in Puerto Rico, but the devastating Hurricane Maria knocked out power to the entire island. As of Sunday, Puerto Rican officials said there was only about 30 percent of power generation on the island.\n\nControversy over the up to $300 million contract has grown following a report in The Washington Post detailing the mounting questions surrounding the deal.\n\nMembers of Congress from both parties and Puerto Rican officials have called for investigations into the deal.\n\nIt was widely reported that Whitefish only had two full-time employees when Maria made landfall, a number not disputed by Whitefishs own newly-hired media team at the time.\n\nRelated: Democrats Call for Investigation Into Whitefish Energy Contract in Puerto Rico\n\nBut Techmanski told NBC News that figure is incorrect, and that the company had 20-40 full-time employees working projects in Arizona, Montana and Washington State. He said Whitefish has more than 350 workers in Puerto Rico and plans to have more than 500 there soon.\n\n\"We're here doing actual work,\" Techmanski said. \"We're under a contract and we came in good faith, and I think we're making an impact.\"\n\nTechmanski also strongly denied that U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who is also from Whitefish, Montana, or anyone else in President Donald Trumps administration had anything to do with his securing the contract.\n\nRelated: Puerto Rico's Frantic Search for Someone to Turn on the Lights\n\nZinke said in a statement Friday that \"I had absolutely nothing to do with Whitefish Energy receiving a contract in Puerto Rico\" and any suggestions of involvement or influence \"are completely baseless.\"\n\nBut a statement from his office acknowledged that the Zinke and the Techmanski families know each other because of the size of the small town and that Zinke's son had worked a summer job at one of the company's construction sites.\n\n\"The Zinkes and the Techmanskis know each other because they both live in a small town (population 6,000) where everyone knows everyone and his son joined a friend who worked a summer job at one of their construction sites,\" said the statement from Zinke's office.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency said in a statement Friday that it had significant concerns and had not approved the deal, despite a portion of the contract that suggested otherwise.\n\n\"That's simply not something we would do,\" Mike Byrne, FEMA's coordinator in Puerto Rico, told NBC News on Saturday.\n\nSan Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, a vocal critic of the deal and the Trump administration in general, said Rossello must now fire the person that signed the contract on MSNBC Sunday following news of the mayors announcement.\n\nThe person responsible for signing the contract must be fired immediately and of course that is the head of PREPA, Ricardo Ramos, she said.\n\nGabe Gutierrez reported from San Juan. Daniella Silva reported from New York City.",

      "text": "Puerto Rican born and raised, Colonel Michael A. Valle (Torch), Commander, 101st Air and Space Operations Group, and Director of the Joint Air Component Coordination Element, 1st Air Force, responsible for Hurricane Maria relief efforts, has the following comment:\n\nIts a lack of drivers for the transport trucks, the 18 wheelers. Supplies we have. Trucks we have. There are ships full of supplies, backed up in the ports, waiting to have a vehicle to unload into. However, only 20% of the truck drivers show up to work. These are private citizens in Puerto Rico, paid by companies that are contracted by the government.. (link)\n\nThe ports are so full of relief supplies they cant fit any more on the available space. CNBC ground report confirms Colonel Valles ground report.  WATCH:\n\nThe reason for truck drivers not showing up?  The Puerto Rican Truckers Union, Frente Amplio, is refusing to move the product.\n\nThe older man in this video (below) is the boss of a very sketchy (corrupt and violent) Puerto Rico truckers union called Fente Amplio. The Union Leaders name is Victor Rodriguez. The reporter is pleading with Rodriquez to set aside his political grievances with the Puerto Rican governor. Mr. Rodriquez (toothless) angrily shouts NO, and states the truck drivers have a right to be mad and will punish Puerto Rico to prove their unions strength.\n\nLabor union head Victor Rodriquez is complaining about a law that the governor passed three weeks ago. The reporter CONFIRMS that the truck drivers are refusing to work in order to get revenge on the governor. Rodriguez says that the governors policies have impacted truckers, so now truckers will show the country THEIR OWN suffering. The reporters says, But all this stuff is in the past. In the present, its an emergency. Rodriguez guy says that the country can now experience what the truckers experience due to the governors policies. Rodriquez says the truckers are not responsible for helping the country. Thats the governors job. Three weeks earlier, nobody cared about the plight of the truckers, so now the truckers dont care about the country. This is all the governors fault, Rodriguez says. He passed a law, and now he has to live with it. The governor didnt understand the suffering of the working man, so now the truckers will show the country what suffering is. Since the country doesnt care about truckers, the truckers wont help.\n\nHeres another report with three independent sources confirming the work stoppage:\n\nWAPA Television confirmed that the strike is related to a recently passed law known as The Senate Project 525 meant to Administratively Transform the Public Service Commission. The law covers the recognition of UBER and other transportation methods but Rodriguez refuses to listen to reason or hear related facts. The law is more commonly known as The Senates 525 Project. This video should dispel the rumors as to whether or not the supplies are sitting in the port because there isnt fuel or because the drivers have been instructed NOT to drive.\n\nThere is no question that drivers were ordered NOT TO TOUCH THE TRUCKS as a retaliatory measure against the Governor of Puerto Rico. The Mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yulin decided to keep her mouth shut about the strike and insult President Trump instead. It was a foolish and unfortunate choice considering Puerto Rico is out in the middle of the ocean. President Trump doubled down his efforts and was preparing for the tragedy even before the hurricanes hit Puerto Rico.\n\nBeing a builder by profession and knowing what construction can handle (or not) Pres. Trump took tremendous measures and made extraordinary attempts to get goods to Puerto Rico and succeeded. The last thing he expected was that the local drivers would refuse to drive the trucks. When the statement of a rumor came up, we confirmed with three (3) independent and directly involved sources within media on the island as well as with Victor Rodriguez whether the strike rumor was true or not. Rodriguez stated that he would not change his position. (read more)\n\nMeanwhile, amid floods and lack of power the Mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yulin Cruz, finds a way to get propaganda T-Shirts to politicize the tragedy on very fake news CNN.",

      "text": "When Donald Trump hinted that he may end aid to Puerto Rico over the mayor of San Juans decision to withhold aid from the rest of the country, the citys other leaders finally took action.\n\nWhile Puerto Ricos Governor has praised Donald Trumps efforts to quell the suffering of the people affected by Hurricane Maria, many of those efforts have been in vain because supplies come in to San Juan, and the mayor has been stingy with distribution.\n\nWe simply dont have the staff or resources  to distribute countrywide, mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz told a local newspaper, adding that anyone can come to San Juan if they need supplies.\n\nUnfortunately, that explanation was not good enough for her peers. In an emergency meeting on Thursday,  the city council held an emergency meeting to initiate impeachment proceedings which begin on Monday.\n\nDonald Trump has helped Puerto Rico and other hurricane-affected areas much more efficiently than any previous President, and Puerto Rico needs to replace their leadership with someone who understands and appreciates that before they lose the aid we arent even required to give them.",

      "text": "A cache of weapons long suspected to be hidden in Texas during Operation Jade Helm 15 was uncovered by the flood waters of Hurricane Harvey. The stockpile, hidden in a small town outside of Lexmar, matches numbers in the inventory reported missing during Obamas tenure.\n\nObama and his administration flat out refused to answer where more than 200 million rounds of ammunition went while he was commander-in-chief. The traitor always maintained that there had to be a clerical error. Now that nearly 10 percent of that ammo has been found, little question remains what happened to it.\n\nThe questions that do remain will have to be answered. There are 180 million rounds of ammunition out there that could be slated for use by an invasion force led by Barack Hussein Obama. He has almost a billion dollars worth of weapons and equipment. Having stockpiles of automatic rifle ammo, hand grenades and mortar shells dispersed around the country would come in awfully handy in an all-out ground assault.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions said that the stockpile is being carefully inventoried to try to establish a chain of custody. Many of the lot numbers that appear on the cases have simply vanished from the GAOs accounting. When all is said and done, there will be few people between the manufacturer and the last officer to order a lot moved. Someone will be forced to pony up some answers.\n\nHopefully, this will put an end to Obamas Deep State Shadow Government. If it can be established that he stole from the taxpayers for a planned coup after he left office, he can be charged with high treason.",

      "title": "Puerto Rican officials claim the water crisis is under control. Reports on the ground tell a very different story.", 
      "text": "On October 16, the governor of Puerto Rico announced some good news: 72 percent of Puerto Ricans now had running water to drink and bathe with  a huge improvement since Hurricane Maria pummeled the island on September 20, leaving most residents without water and power.\n\nGov. Ricardo Rossellos figure came from the public water utility company, the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, and is updated on the government's website status.pr. As of Wednesday, the water company's statistics said 75 percent of the island had water, with regions varying from 88 percent (the South) to 46 percent (the North).\n\nBut Voxs review of publicly available information on the state of the water supply and interviews with local officials on the ground revealed a situation that is more dire than the official statistics suggest. Many towns on the island have been without running water for more than a month, and many that have it cant count on it to be reliable.\n\n\"It's so frustrating,\" said Rosachely Rivera Santana, the mayor of Gurabo, a small town in the eastern interior, where the generator powering the local water plant keeps failing. \"It makes no sense to give such a high statistic when the reality is so different.\"\n\nEven the government's own data contradicts its optimistic narrative and shows how severely water services have been affected by the ongoing power outages. A detailed breakdown on the website shows which facilities are getting electricity. Only 15 out of 167 water treatment and distribution plants have regular power, and only 16 out of 2,186 water pumping stations are hooked to the power grid. Without electricity, water distribution sites can't filter and pump water into homes.\n\nPlus, the water company is telling residents the water out of the tap isnt safe to drink. On its website, PRASA is urging those who have running water to boil it or purify it with chlorine tablets before drinking. With 75 percent of the island still without reliable electricity, boiling water is hard, if not impossible. Which is a reminder of just what a significant threat to health this breakdown in the municipal water system is.\n\nSo when Rossello offered his upbeat claim last week about the widespread availability of potable water, he sparked a backlash on Twitter. When he sent a tweet with even more optimistic statistics a few days later, the response was just as harsh.\n\n\"I don't know where, because in Dorado, the Puertos neighborhood has been without water for 15 days. Stop lying Mr. governor please!!!\" replied one resident.\n\nJoel Lugo Rosa, an engineer for the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, told Vox in an email that the 75 percent statistic includes water plants that are running on generators. It also includes water tankers theyve sent to communities to let residents fill up containers with drinking water.\n\nHe also acknowledged that the generators frequently break down or run out of fuel. \"In many cases, water service is sporadic because we run out of diesel, or because of maintenance problems with the generators, which weren't designed to run constantly. And most of Puerto Rico hasn't had power from [the utility company] for more than a month,\" he explained.\n\nIt will be impossible to provide regular water service until the electrical grid is repaired. Until then, Puerto Ricans will have to deal with sporadically available water services in many places.\n\nWhile Puerto Rico's government insists that its gotten running water to most of the island, local mayors and city governments suggest that is far from true.\n\nGurabo Mayor Rosachely Rivera Santana laughed when I asked her on the phone if she believed the government statistics.\n\n\"We need to be realistic about what's happening every day,\" she said. \"The truth is it changes constantly. Maybe there was one day when 72 percent had water, but then the next day it could have gone down to 30 [percent].\"\n\nRivera said the local water plant in her town still has no electricity, so it can't pump water into homes and businesses. She arranged to bring in a generator to provide partial power. With the help of water utility workers, she got running water to about 40 percent of residents at one point, until it started raining last week.\n\nFlooding damaged the distribution and pumping systems and knocked out the delicate system they had rigged together.\n\n\"The generators and pipes are very sensitive,\" she said. \"It will take another six or seven days to get it working again, but then it will just shut down again.\"\n\nIn Juncos, a town 5 miles away, Mayor Alfredo Alejandro Carrion told Primera Hora that 85 percent of residents didn't have drinking water a month after the storm hit. He told the newspaper that he traveled to San Juan several times to request a generator for the water plant, but that FEMA and the National Guard were unable to get him one:\n\nVox emailed more than a dozen mayors across Puerto Rico, though many of the messages bounced back. When reached via Facebook last week, the mayors' offices in Arecibo and Guaynabo  two of Puerto Rico's largest cities, with a combined population of about 186,000 people  said that they didn't have regular running water either.\n\n\"As of this moment, we don't have regular water service. We still have many areas that aren't getting any water,\" wrote a staff member who works for Angel Perez Otero, the mayor of Guaynabo.\n\nVolunteers for the website CrowdRescueHQ have been scanning social media and news reports in Puerto Rico for signs of people who still need help. (They share the data with FEMA and emergency responders.) Many of the 60 reports theyve collected since October 16 convey a desperate situation for families.\n\nIn one case, volunteers cited a television news story in Penuelas, a town on the southern coast. \"Water is urgently needed, both in the shelters and for the general population.\" It was posted the same day the governor announced the statistics.\n\nSo was another post from a few miles away in Yauco: \"Families in rural areas without drinkable water.\"\n\nAnd this one: \"Residents of Mayaguez, San German, Cabo Rojob, Lajas, Anasco, Hormigueros, Moca, Aguada, Aguadilla, San Sebastian and other villages are concerned about the lack of potable water, bread, coffee, and ice among other primary necessities.\"\n\nMany are also taking to Twitter to beg for water service, as this woman did on October 23: \"Arecibo's Hato neighborhood, 33 days without water... PLEASE EVEN IF IT'S JUST ONE DAY A WEEK, WE NEED IT.\"\n\nPuerto Ricans without regular running water right now are faced with three options: They can buy drinking water, look for free water supplies, or, in the worst-case scenario, drink water from streams and lakes.\n\nRight now, more than 30 days since the storm, FEMA is still delivering bottled water to more than a dozen distribution sites on the island. The mayors of each town often have to pick up those supplies themselves and distribute them to residents. That kind of setup isn't a long-term solution, especially because it's not enough water for people to bathe in or wash their clothes.\n\nGiving the impression that three-quarters of the island has clean running water is more than a public relations stunt. It could create a perception in Washington, DC, that Puerto Rico is recovering more quickly than it actually is, and could impact how much money Congress is willing to put in the FEMA disaster relief fund  where reconstruction grants come from.\n\nFormer FEMA officials with decades of experience in disaster zones have told Vox that this is most difficult and complicated mission FEMA has ever faced. They say Puerto Rico's reconstruction will take years and billions of dollars in federal money.\n\nIf the local government is misleading the public about the status of the recovery, it puts less pressure on members of Congress to make sure FEMA and Puerto Rico have enough resources in the long run. And it's really pissing off Puerto Ricans who want running water right now.",

      "text": "Tesla Turns Power Back On At Children's Hospital In Puerto Rico\n\nTesla has used its solar panels and batteries to restore reliable electricity at San Juan's Hospital del Nino (Children's Hospital), in what company founder Elon Musk calls \"the first of many solar+battery Tesla projects going live in Puerto Rico.\"\n\nThe project came about after Puerto Rico was hit by two devastating and powerful hurricanes in September, and Musk reached out about Tesla helping.\n\nMusk's company announced its success in getting the hospital's power working again less than three weeks after Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello tweeted on Oct. 6, \"Great initial conversation with @elonmusk tonight. Teams are now talking; exploring opportunities.\"\n\nTesla's image of the project's solar array, in a parking lot next to the hospital, has been liked more than 84,000 times since it was posted to Instagram Tuesday.\n\nEarlier this month, Musk tweeted that some of his company's work is being rerouted so it could \"increase battery production for Puerto Rico & other affected areas.\"\n\nThe hospital's new system allows it to generate all the energy it needs, according to El Nuevo Dia. The facility has 35 permanent residents with chronic conditions; it also offers services to some 3,000 young patients, the newspaper says. As for who is paying for the power system, the head of the hospital tells Nuevo Dia that for now, it's a donation  and that after the energy crisis is over, a deal could make it permanent.\n\nBoth Rossello and the tech company tweeted about the project this week, with Tesla saying in a post, \"Grateful to support the recovery of Puerto Rico with @ricardorossello\"  and Rossello stating, \"A major contribution of @Tesla to the Hospital del Nino.\"\n\nThe news of restoring permanent power at the hospital comes as millions of people in Puerto Rico continue to rely on generators for electricity. As of Wednesday morning, the Electric Power Authority reported that its power service was at 25 percent.\n\nThe task of rebuilding Puerto Rico's power grid is expected to take months and to cost as much as $5 billion.\n\nLast week, the territory's electric and power authority signed a $300 million contract with Whitefish, a small and relatively young Montana company, to restore the power grid. The deal has sparked scrutiny and skepticism, as NPR's Laurel Wamsley and Nicky Ouellet of Montana Public Radio reported.\n\nTesla isn't the only tech company trying to help Puerto Rico; Google's parent company, Alphabet, has deployed balloons from its Project Loon to the territory, to help parts of the island reconnect after much of its phone system went down. The portable network can help phone users with both messaging and some web browsing.",

      "text": "A nurse dispatched to Puerto Rico by the Registered Nurse Response Network described the islands dire situation earlier this month. A line formed outside FEMA in Rio Grande two nights ago, she wrote in a public letter. People waited 24 hours only to receive 1 16oz water and one snack size Cheez-its. The people of Puerto Rico are starving and have no access to water.... They have turned off the water and we are running out of bottled water.\n\nA humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding, and the federal government urgently needs to fund public services, transportation, and basic goods. But, rather than provide the money as aid, Congress approved a $5 billion loan, which will only add to the islands immense debt. On top of that, Puerto Rico has little say over how it will be rebuilt. In 2016, the federal government appointed a seven-person Federal Oversight and Management Board (FOMB) to restructure the islands debt, with the belief that the US territory needed sweeping cuts. Austerity, exacerbated by the FOMB, had already deteriorated the quality of life, but the ravages of Hurricane Maria have made local control and additional spending critical. Instead, hands tied, the islands elected governor has been reduced to nonprofit fundraising.\n\nPuerto Rico should be a cautionary tale for the mainland United States. The legal theories that have been applied to Puerto Rico also undergird the emergency management of cities like Detroit, Flint, and Atlantic City, where elected local governments have been suspended in favor of financial overseers tasked with imposing regimes of economic austerity.\n\nAt the root of this antidemocratic approach is the idea that the elected government in any given crisis is to blame for the economic distress. As Puerto Ricos financial situation worsened in 2016, a dominant narrative emerged that it was corruptionand not population decline, poverty, and the federal governments role in encouraging Puerto Ricos debt (by allowing people to lend money to the island without paying any taxes)that caused the problems. And if a government is unable or unwilling to pass the kind of tough policies needed to help its constituents in a fiscal emergency, then suspending it becomes justified.\n\nThis paradigm of austerity-based intervention is supported by a growing body of legal and economic theory. In 2014, Clayton Gillette of New York University Law and David Skeel Jr. of University of Pennsylvania Law began drafting a transformative legal argument about municipal bankruptcies. The paper was published in 2016 in The Yale Law Journal, under the title: Governance Reform and the Judicial Role in Municipal Bankruptcy. It sounds dry, but its implications are far-reaching.\n\nIn the piece, the lawyers rigorously defend the legal theory that municipal governments ought to be treated like private corporations when they go bankrupt. To Skeel and Gillette, local governments and private corporations share many similarities. Both, they write, are vehicles for providing goods and services. Skeel told me by phone that one of the key questions they explore in their work is, To what extent is it appropriate to use the kinds of processes used for private entities, when youre talking about a public entity? Everything Just Got Worse for Donald Trump Manafort Monday Turns Into a Very Bad Day for Trumpand Mike Pence Could Paul Manafort Bring Down the Whole Trump Family? The Houston Texans Showed the Power and Dignity of Black Labor When a private corporation goes bankrupt, judges can make permanent reforms to the corporations governing structure. A prime example is what happened to Chrysler, whose board of directors was reorganized by a judge during its 2009 bankruptcy. But judges dont have the same power to restructure bankrupt cities and towns. No plan of adjustment has ever granted the creditors a seat on the city council, Skeel and Gillette write in their journal article. Creditors, they argue, should be able to dislodge the current governance structure during times of fiscal crisis. Skeel and Gillette offer judges, financial overseers, and politicians a new language that they can use; pensioners become shareholders of the local government, and are treated the same as profit-motivated creditors. Gillette, who provided pro bono advice to Detroits emergency manager, told me there is ample evidence to suggest that certain governmental reforms enhance the fiscal stability of cities. Gillette said cities might consider granting mayors broad veto powers; institute at-large, rather than district-based, representation on city councils; and require multiyear budgeting to constrict public officials spending powers. But of course, these types of reforms are either highly controversial or would never be passed by elected officials. This is where their central argument comes into play. One plausible technical solution to the obstacle of popular consent, they write, is to treat bankrupt municipalities as though they were a private corporation. That way, the structure of government could be changed at the stroke of a judges pen. They recognize that this is aggressive (and perhaps normatively objectionable). The two legal thinkers know their ideas are unpopular, but that doesnt change their belief that temporary periods of dictatorship are often necessary. There are democracy issues, Skeel told me, but the case for [using a control board to institute government reforms]...is that when a public entity is in deep financial distress there is almost always some government dysfunction connected with it. The intervention of an oversight board, he continued, can sometimes catalyze reform that makes the entity more democratic and responsive...but you go through a process that is not democratic, theres no question about that. Gillette wrote another essay in 2014 titled Dictatorships for Democracy: Takeovers of Financially Failed Cities, which advocates dictatura rei gerundae causa, or the dictatorship for getting things done. He argues that takeover boards should be allowed to exceed the limits of the Roman dictator, who was [allowed to take control during crises but] prohibited from making changes to the constitutional structure of the republic. As Gillette explained to me, A financial-control board can sometimes do things that are either politically unpopular with important groups or that constrain political officials, which elected political officials would never push for, even though there are positive effects for the residents of the municipality as a whole. So, is that antidemocratic? Well, define democratic. Even laying aside the undemocratic nature of oversight boards, the solutions they impose on populations are often painful and ineffective. Just ask anyone in Flint. According to local-government expert Michelle Wilde Anderson of Stanford University Law, when fiscal problems are caused by chronic poverty, population decline, and the federal governments encouragement of debt, the situation wont be fixed with better spreadsheets or fiscal tools. If a household isnt bringing in enough money because of a job loss or injury, Anderson told me, you cant tell them they need better financial management.... If its a revenue problem, what they need is a living-wage job, not a financial expert to prohibit them from buying groceries. In struggling cities in Michigan and Pennsylvania, Anderson said, many expert financial managers got in there and saw the revenue collapse, and there was nothing they could do about it. They dont have new funding or special tools to bring the citys people out of poverty. And so they get the hell out of there in a few years, leaving the city no better off than it was before. When poverty, postindustrial decline, and population loss (or a hurricane) are the sources of economic crisis, you cant blame the government, and therefore suspending it becomes less justified. While Anderson is quick to say she is not against the notion of takeover laws full stop, she thinks control boards should not be given powers superior to those of an elected official: We have to give the electeds all the tools that we think are needed to keep a citys budget balanced. Gillette, on the other hand, suggests, in Dictatorships for Democracy, that lack of results from control boards is likely because they have failed to use the opportunity of what he calls extraordinary politics, or dictatorship, to make permanent structural changes. A solution, he argues, may be to deploy the most controversial, nondemocratic characteristic of restructuring local government. This, he acknowledges, implies a very broad and autocratic use of takeover board authority. In 2015, Gillette and Skeel co-authored an op-ed in The New York Times calling on the federal government to create a control board with serious teeth to govern Puerto Ricos finances. In the op-ed, they point to New York States 1975 appointment of a financial-control board to oversee New York Citys finances and Michigans use of emergency management to suspend Detroits local government in 2013 as precedents to inform the federal governments approach to fiscally distressed Puerto Rico. There was nothing stopping the federal government from doing something similar in Puerto Rico, they argued. Because Puerto Rico is a territory, Skeel and Gillettes 2015 Times op-ed is accurate. Just as states can unilaterally intervene to suspend municipal democratic control in Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and elsewhere, so too can the federal government in Puerto Rico. Nine months later, Obama signed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act, or PROMESA, which effectively removed the financial powers of the Puerto Rican government and the autonomy of its 78 municipalities. Two months after that, Skeel himself was appointed to serve on the Federal Oversight and Management Board. I probably would have tinkered with a few things, Skeel told me, referring to the design of the fiscal-control board, but what they did looks quite a bit like what we were proposing. The two of them followed the op-ed with a 2016 paper further detailing their vision for a control board and fiscal and political restructuring in Puerto Rico. The effect of financial oversight after Hurricane Maria is that the elected Puerto Rican government can neither spend money to revitalize the islands public services nor can it provide basic disaster recovery or a rigorous jobs program without the boards approval. Maria changes everything, Skeel told me, repeatedly. The FOMB announced that Maria would force them to revise their financial plan for the island. Tax revenues are not coming in, Skeel said, and expenses have not disappeared. Borrowing money would be very difficult. The money will run out if theres no money from Washington. But a control board was not the only debt-restructuring tool Skeel and Gillette supported. They also wrote an amicus curiae brief in defense of Puerto Ricos 2014 Recovery Act, which would have given the islands municipalities and other government bodies access to US bankruptcy-like proceedings to restructure their debt. The law was eventually struck down by the US Supreme Court after creditors challenged the law. Their defense of Puerto Ricos 2014 Recovery Act was in opposition to hedge funds, who wanted to be repaid in full. The fiscal-control board has also upset many of the islands creditors for similar reasons. According to an analysis by Kate Aronoff, before Hurricane Maria the board developed a plan that would wipe out 79 percent of the territorys annual debt payments. But its not just creditors whom the board has dismayed. Cuts to the public-education system, the appointment of an emergency manager to control the electric grid, talks of furloughs and pension reforms, and the financial-control boards vote to approve the wind down of Puerto Ricos Government Development Bank (GDB) have all drawn scorn from locals. Though the GDB has a past checkered with accusations of clientelism and irresponsible debt issuances, it was nonetheless the financial nerve center of the island, providing key financial services to the islands cities and government agencies. According to a lawsuit brought by the city of San Juan, the way the GDB is being dismantled disempowers local governments by lumping them in with the rest of the banks creditors. The municipalitiesgiven one vote eachare being outvoted. As a result, millions of dollars of municipal-tax revenue that the GDB held in trust will be taken from the municipalities to pay all of GDBs creditors, including public bondholders, according to the San Juan lawsuit. That is bad news for cities responsible for providing medical care and policing. Last month, a federal judge denied San Juans effort to stop the GDBs restructuring. The result of this is similar to the effects of a law in Rhode Island that Gillette highlighted in Dictatorships for Democracy. Passed in response to the municipal bankruptcy of Central Falls, the legislation required cities to impose taxes to pay off bond holders directlycircumventing pensions and public services. What it does is it creates whats called a first link lien, Gillette said, so before those tax revenues can be used for other purposes, the creditors have a first claim on them. And the result of that in Central Falls, was that the bond holders did not get a haircut, and the pensioners got a severe haircut. Gillette told me, Puerto Ricos municipalities are facing the same issues that confront cities [on the mainland]. And Melissa Mays, Flint resident and founder of the group Water You Fighting For?, agrees. The most glaring [similarity], Mays wrote in an e-mail, is that poor people are blamed for their own situation. In Flint, they tried to blame the careless water switch on Flint residents because we supposedly didnt have enough money to pay our water bills.... In Puerto Rico, theyre trying to say that they were worse off before the hurricane, because they were so poor, and its their fault that they do not have better disaster resources. Hurricane Maria should be an existential crisis for Puerto Ricos FOMB. The unfolding crisis can no longer be pinned on Puerto Ricos government. The argument justifying the FOMBs existence has disappeared. Meanwhile, residents fill the vacuum left by the government. Mays said, You have the poor and poisoned in both disasters taking care of the poor and poisoned because the government refuses to.... The more democracy we lose, the more lives are lost.",

      "title": "Why You Shouldnt Donate To The Red Cross To Help Hurricane Victims ...", 
      "text": "Ever since Hurricane Harvey touched down in East Texas last Friday, it has already left a severe and deathly path of destruction. As of now, there have been 10 people reported dead and hundreds injured. It has also been reported that roughly 30,000 people will be in shelters and around 450,000 will need some sort of assistance in this disaster. What makes this even worse is that there isnt an end in sight yet and forecasters say there is a lot more rain to come.\n\nAs with any natural disaster, many organizations jump in to offer as much help as they can. From providing victims with resources they need on hand to asking globally for donations, they do as much as they can to relieve the burden for those in need. Especially when it comes to donations, they aim to give it all towards those who need it most.\n\nWell, except the Red Cross Association.\n\nThe Red Cross Association has a terrible history of raising a lot of money in donations for disaster relief and not actually putting good use to it. During the 2010 earthquake that struck Haiti, the Red Cross raised around half a billion dollars in donations, yet only built six permanent homes for victims who lost everything they had. There were 3 million people affected by that earthquake and had a death toll of 230,000. Back in 2016 , it was said that they now live in shacks made of rusty sheet metal. They do not have access to safe, drinkable water, electricity or even sanitation. When it rains, their homes will flood and residents are forced to dig out the mud and water. What happened to the half a billion dollars in donations? They refused to answer.\n\nThe most important thing is an unwillingness to level with the people exactly where the money went, Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley says . Theres too many questions in regard to how the money was spent in Haiti ... it gives me cause to wonder about other money being donated for other national disasters.\n\nThis even goes back further than their Haiti scandal. When the World Trade Center went down back in 2001, the Red Cross this time raised over a billion dollars in donations. Again, victims of the terrorist attack never saw the money. They opened only a few shelters during the attack and no one came to them. They even handed out coffee and donuts for the rescue workers on site, yet charged them for the food and drinks.\n\nAs more natural disasters happened, more sketchy details came to light. The Huffington Post reported that while the Red Cross gave Hurricane Katrina victims food, shelter and helped them relocate to hotels, they get reimbursed for it with pre-existing contracts as long as theres a state or federal disaster declaration. After Hurricane Katrina, victims saw the same problem with the Red Cross raising a lot of money, yet never actually seeing it used to help.\n\nWhats especially sad about this is that the Red Cross is still heavily promoted by celebrities and politicians. We constantly see TV specials and commercials with a popular athlete, singer or actor asking you to donate to their cause. As if using the worlds most famous people to promote them, they use images of victims to make views feel more compelled to donate. And it works. They always come out on top.\n\nWe cannot let this happen to Texas. Residents are begging for people to donate anywhere, except the Red Cross. People are still stranded on top of their roofs and are trapped by severe flooding. This hurricane still isnt over and people are losing their homes, keepsakes and even their lives.\n\nInstead of donating to the Red Cross, here are some other places you can donate to:",

      "text": "The damage inflicted on world stocks this week by the escalating war of words over North Korea has topped $1 trillion, it has emerged.\n\nAmerican and Asian stocks have plunged with investors fleeing to safe haven assets including gold and German government bonds, seen as one of the safest financial securities in the world.\n\nIt comes as US President Donald Trump stepped up his rhetoric in the on-going North Korean nuclear missile stand-off.\n\nTrump said his earlier pledge to unleash 'fire and fury' on North Korea may not have been tough enough, after Pyongyang's state run news agency said earlier it would complete plans in mid-August to fire four missiles to land near Guam.\n\nU.S. and Asian stocks plunged overnight, with investors instead fleeing to traditionally safer assets including German government bonds, among the best-rated and most liquid assets in the world.\n\nInvestors also took cover in the yen, the Swiss franc and gold.\n\nWith the tense mood pushing European shares down for a third day and Wall Street set to fall again, global stocks were on course for their worst week since Trump won November's U.S. presidential election.\n\nNow installed in the White House, Trump issued a new warning to Pyongyang on Friday, tweeting: 'Military solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely.'\n\nJapanese markets were closed for a holiday but the yen powered on, hitting an eight-week high of 108.91 yen to the dollar, adding to its biggest weekly gain since May.\n\nThe yen tends to benefit during times of geopolitical or financial stress as Japan is the world's biggest creditor nation and there is an assumption that Japanese investors there will repatriate funds should a crisis materialise.\n\nThe Swiss franc, the other traditional safety-play among currencies, has benefited too. Two weeks ago it saw its biggest weakly fall against the euro since the start of 2015. This week has seen its biggest rise since June 2016.\n\nAnd in bond markets, 10-year U.S. Treasuries and Germany's ultra-safe government bonds, known as Bunds, were trading at their highest prices since June.\n\n'We do just not know what happens next with the North Korea situation,' said BNY Mellon FX strategist Neil Mellor.\n\n'For quite some time the market hasn't really reacted to things on the Korean Peninsula because we know from the past it is largely North Korean sabre-rattling, and it may yet be. But with the rhetoric having gone to a different level, the market just can't afford to take that risk.'\n\nMany world stock markets have hit record or multi-year highs in recent weeks, leaving them vulnerable to a sell-off, and the tensions over North Korea have proved the trigger.\n\nThe CBOE Volatility Index, the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term U.S. stock market volatility, hit its highest mark since Nov. 8, when Trump was elected president.\n\nThe Chinese volatility gauge jumped by the most since January 2016, to its highest level in more than seven months. The euro zone's version is at its highest since April, when France's election was rattling the region.\n\nOvernight, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had skidded 1.55 per cent, its biggest one-day loss since mid-December, to leave it down 2.5 percent for the week.\n\n'What has changed this time is that the scary threats and war of words between the U.S. and North Korea have intensified to the point that markets can't ignore it,' said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital in Sydney.\n\n'Of course, it's all come at a time when share markets are due for a correction, so North Korea has provided a perfect trigger.'\n\nSouth Korea's KOSPI fell 1.8 per cent to an 11-1/2-week low, but its losses for the week are a relatively modest 3.2 percent. 'Pretty remarkable, perhaps even extraordinary, considering,' said Tim Ash, strategist at fund manager BlueBay.\n\nThe Korean won also continued to skid, down 0.45 percent to 1,147.2, falling below its 200-day moving average for the first time in a month.\n\nAustralian shares were down 1.3 percent, set for a weekly loss of 0.6 percent and Chinese and Hong Kong bluechips lost 1.6 percent and 1.9 per cent respectively.\n\nA Chinese state-run newspaper said on Friday that China should make clear that it will stay neutral if North Korea launches an attack that threatens the United States, but that if the U.S. attacks first and tries to overthrow North Korea's government, China will prevent it doing so.\n\n'This situation is beginning to develop into this generation's Cuban Missile crisis moment,' ING's chief Asia economist Robert Carnell wrote in a note.\n\nThe market's backstop safety asset, gold, edged up to its latest two-month high of $1,288 an ounce. It soared over 2 per cent in the previous two sessions, and is set for a weekly gain of 2.25 percent.\n\nCrude futures meanwhile extended losses on fears of slowing demand and lingering concerns over global oversupply.\n\nU.S. crude was down 0.9 percent at $48.16 per barrel, on track for a weekly loss of 2.9 percent.\n\nGlobal benchmark Brent also fell 0.9 percent to $51.44, after Thursday's 1.5 percent drop. It is poised to end the week down 1.9 percent. Copper, the bellwether industrial metal, was set for its first weekly drop in five weeks.\n\nAway from the geopolitical drama, U.S. inflation data is due at 1330 GMT. The Korea tensions though have seen both U.S. and European markets this week push back expectations of when the Fed and ECB might hike interest rates.",

      "text": "LONDON  The damage inflicted on world stocks this week by the escalating war of words over North Korea topped $1 trillion on Friday, as investors again took cover in the yen, the Swiss franc, gold and government bonds.\n\nWith the tense mood pushing European shares down for a third day and Wall Street set to fall again, global stocks were on course for their worst week since Donald Trump won November's U.S. presidential election.\n\nJapanese markets were closed for a holiday but the yen powered on, hitting an eight-week high of 108.91 yen to the dollar, adding to its biggest weekly gain since May.\n\nThe yen tends to benefit during times of geopolitical or financial stress as Japan is the world's biggest creditor nation and there is an assumption that Japanese investors there will repatriate funds should a crisis materialize.\n\nThe Swiss franc, the other traditional safety-play among currencies, has benefited too. Two weeks ago it saw its biggest weakly fall against the euro  since the start of 2015. This week has seen its biggest rise since June 2016.\n\n\"For quite some time the market hasn't really reacted to things on the Korean Peninsula because we know from the past it is largely North Korean sabre-rattling, and it may yet be. But with the rhetoric having gone to a different level, the market just can't afford to take that risk.\"\n\nThe Chinese volatility gauge  jumped by the most since January 2016, to its highest level in more than seven months. The euro zone's version is at its highest since April, when France's election was rattling the region.\n\n\"What has changed this time is that the scary threats and war of words between the U.S. and North Korea have intensified to the point that markets can't ignore it,\" said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital in Sydney.\n\nSouth Korea's KOSPI  fell 1.8 percent to an 11-1/2-week low, but its losses for the week are a relatively modest 3.2 percent. \"Pretty remarkable, perhaps even extraordinary, considering,\" said Tim Ash, strategist at fund manager BlueBay.\n\nA Chinese state-run newspaper said on Friday that China should make clear that it will stay neutral if North Korea launches an attack that threatens the United States, but that if the U.S. attacks first and tries to overthrow North Korea's government, China will prevent it doing so.\n\nThe market's backstop safety asset, gold, edged up to its latest two-month high of $1,288 an ounce. It soared over 2 percent in the previous two sessions, and is set for a weekly gain of 2.25 percent.",

      "title": "Siding With Trump, Judge Clears Way for Trial Over Health Subsidies", 
      "text": "The subsidies reimburse insurers for reducing deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket costs for seven million low-income people who buy midlevel silver plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Under the law, insurers will still have to provide the discounts, known as cost-sharing reductions, but may be unable to collect reimbursement from the government.\n\nMr. Trump ordered federal officials two weeks ago to stop making the monthly payments. Another federal district judge, in Washington, ruled in 2016 that the payments were unconstitutional because Congress had never appropriated money for them.\n\nOn Wednesday, Judge Chhabria concluded that both sides have reasonable arguments on the main legal question: Whether Congress appropriated money for the cost-sharing payments.\n\nTwo senior senators, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a Republican, and Patty Murray of Washington, a Democrat, announced last week that they had agreed on a bill to extend the cost-sharing payments through 2019 and make it easier for states to obtain waivers from requirements of the Affordable Care Act. After initially endorsing the deal, Mr. Trump backed off a day later, and the White House demanded changes as a condition of its support.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday that the Alexander-Murray bill would produce a modest reduction in federal budget deficits, but would not substantially change the number of people with coverage.\n\nThe budget office estimated that the legislation would reduce deficits by a total of $3.8 billion over the next decade. With the deficit for the last fiscal year alone reaching $666 billion, that is a relatively small number, but supporters of the bill made the most of it.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office has found that our proposal benefits taxpayers, it benefits consumers  not insurance companies, said Mr. Alexander, the chairman of the Senate health committee.\n\nThe proposal has broad support from Democratic senators and at least a dozen Republican senators. But conservative Republicans in the House and the Senate have denounced it as a bailout for insurers, and Mr. Trump has sent mixed signals about whether he supports it. Representative Dave Brat, Republican of Virginia, called the measure a nonstarter.\n\nThe budget office said that continuing the cost-sharing payments would not change its estimate of federal spending because it had already assumed that the government would pay the subsidies: $9 billion a year in 2018 and 2019, and a total of $99 billion from 2018 to 2027.\n\nThe Trump administration on Wednesday unveiled a new version of the HealthCare.gov website showing premiums and other details of health insurance plans that will be offered for sale in the open enrollment period that starts next week.\n\nIn many markets, consumers will have few choices and will see high sticker prices before taking account of financial assistance for which they may qualify. But by carefully shopping around, consumers will often be able to find bargains  a point highlighted in the case in California, where the state runs its own marketplace.\n\nDuring Mondays hearing, state officials told Judge Chhabria that cutting off the subsidy payments would cause immediate and irreparable harm to states and to consumers, increasing the likelihood that insurers would pull out of the marketplace.\n\nBut Judge Chhabria said California and most of the other state plaintiffs saw the writing on the wall a long time ago  that the administration was going to terminate these payments to insurance companies to subsidize co-payments and deductibles.\n\nCalifornia is doing a really good job of responding to the termination of these payments in a way that is not only avoiding harm for people, but actually benefiting people, the judge added.\n\nIn his Wednesday ruling, Judge Chhabria wrote that low-income people who now have silver plans in some cases may be able to find gold plans with lower premiums and lower deductibles for 2018.\n\nTo offset the expected loss of cost-sharing subsidies, California added a surcharge to the price of midlevel silver plans sold on its Affordable Care Act marketplace. When premiums go up, consumers receive more financial assistance to help with premium costs, so in many cases they will be no worse off.\n\nNearly four out of five consumers will see their premiums stay the same or decrease, since the amount of financial help they receive will also rise, Californias insurance marketplace announced earlier this month. In addition, it said, three-fourths of consumers in the state who are eligible for assistance will be able to buy low-cost bronze health plans next year for less than $10 a month.\n\nThe state of California is standing on the courthouse steps denouncing the president for taking away peoples health care, Judge Chhabria said at Mondays hearing, when the truth is that California has come up with a solution to that issue that is going to result in better health care for a lot of people.\n\nMany other states have taken similar steps to minimize harm to consumers, the judge said. He was appointed in 2014 by President Barack Obama.",
