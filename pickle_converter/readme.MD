If you are using the NELA toolkit on Windows, you may run into problems with the pickled files (any file that ends in .sav). This error will look one of two ways: 1. the table on /credibilitytoolkit will not load or 2. you will see the error no module named copy_reg. 

To fix this, simply download these 3 files, place them outside the The-NELA-Toolkit directory, and run the python file.
